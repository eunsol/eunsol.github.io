<blue>1</blue>New man for a new <e6>NASA </e6>mission Forget space shuttles , orbiting telescopes , and more robotic rovers on <e5>Mars </e5>. <br><blue>2</blue>The next mission for <e6>NASA </e6>could be to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program . <br><blue>3</blue>This weekend , the agency bade farewell to administrator <e2>Daniel </e2><e2>Goldin </e2>, who resigned after 10 years in office - an agency record . <br><blue>4</blue><e0><eC>President </eC></e0><e0><eC>Bush </eC></e0>has nominated <e8>Sean </e8><e8>O'Keefe </e8>, <e8><eC>deputy </eC></e8><e8><eC>director </eC></e8><e8><eC>of </eC></e8><e8><eC>the </eC></e8><e12><eC>the </eC></e12><e8><eC>White </eC></e8><e12><eC>White </eC></e12><e8><eC>House </eC></e8><e12><eC>House </eC></e12><e8><eC>'s </eC></e8><e12><eC>'s </eC></e12><e8><eC>Office </eC></e8><e12>Office </e12><e8><eC>of </eC></e8><e12>of </e12><e8><eC>Management </eC></e8><e12>Management </e12><e8><eC>and </eC></e8><e12>and </e12><e8><eC>Budget </eC></e8><e12>Budget </e12>, to replace <e8><eC>him </eC></e8>. <br><blue>5</blue>In doing so , <e12><eC>the </eC></e12><e12><eC>White </eC></e12><e12><eC>House </eC></e12>is swapping the silver-visored helmet of a space cadet for the green eyeshade of a consummate bean counter . <br><blue>6</blue>Where <e2><eC>Mr. </eC></e2><e2><eC>Goldin </eC></e2>was a product of the <e11>US </e11>aerospace industry , <e8><eC>Mr. </eC></e8><e8><eC>O'Keefe </eC></e8>has served as chief financial officer for the <e10>Pentagon </e10>, <e7>Navy </e7>secretary , and business-school professor . <br><blue>7</blue>`` <e8>O'Keefe </e8>is not known as a space enthusiast , '' says <e4>Keith </e4><e4>Cowing </e4>, a former <e6>NASA </e6>scientist and editor of NASAWatch.com . <br><blue>8</blue>`` But he may be what the agency needs right now . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Under <e2>Goldin </e2>, unmanned craft found evidence of water on the moon , inaugurated a long-term program to explore <e5>Mars </e5>, and opened the door to competition from the aerospace industry and universities to plan and execute missions . <br><blue>10</blue>With a mandate to cut costs , <e2>Goldin </e2>implemented a `` faster , better , cheaper '' approach . <br><blue>11</blue>In the spring of 1992 , the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <e9>Pasadena </e9>, <e1>Calif. </e1>, `` had five spacecraft in space and three or four under development , '' <e2><eC>he </eC></e2>said last month . <br><blue>12</blue>`` Today , we have 13 in space and 27 under development . '' <br><blue>13</blue>But the agency 's credibility has come under fire in manned spaceflight - especially the <e3>International </e3><e3>Space </e3><e3>Station </e3>, now completing its first year of full-time crews . <br><blue>14</blue>The project 's costs , like those of the space-shuttle program before it , have ballooned far beyond original estimates - from an initial $ 17.4 billion to more than $ 30 billion . <br><blue>15</blue>Early on , the <e0>Bush </e0>administration planned to scale back <e11>US </e11>involvement to a `` core '' station with a crew of three instead of six . <br></div>
