<blue>1</blue>Ministry Criticizes ` Odious ' U.S. Report The <e4>Foreign </e4><e4>Ministry </e4>said Thursday that it was `` surprised , to put it mildly '' by <e11><eC>the </eC></e11><e11><eC>U.S. </eC></e11><e11><eC>State </eC></e11><e11><eC>Department </eC></e11><e11><eC>'s </eC></e11>criticism of <e8><eC>Russia </eC></e8><e8><eC>'s </eC></e8>human rights record and objected in particular to the `` odious '' section on <e2>Chechnya </e2>. <br><blue>2</blue>`` One gets the impression that its writers simply used old drafts , as if nothing had happened in either <e8>Russia </e8>or the <e12>United </e12><e12>States </e12>in recent years , as if the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 had not occurred and the international community had not closed ranks in the battle against terrorism , '' the ministry said in a statement . <br><blue>3</blue><e11><eC>The </eC></e11><e11><eC>State </eC></e11><e11><eC>Department </eC></e11><e11><eC>'s </eC></e11>annual human rights report , which was published Monday , said <e8>Russia </e8>had a poor record regarding the independence and freedom of the media and in <e2>Chechnya </e2>. <br><blue>4</blue><e8>Russian </e8>security forces in <e2>Chechnya </e2>have `` demonstrated little respect for basic human rights and there were credible reports of serious violations , including numerous reports of extrajudicial killings by both the government and <e1>Chechen </e1>fighters , '' the report said . <br><blue>5</blue><e8>Russian </e8>officials from President <e13>Vladimir </e13><e13>Putin </e13>on down have portrayed the conflict in <e2>Chechnya </e2>as a war against international terrorists . <br><blue>6</blue><e12>U.S. </e12>officials have partially endorsed that view , pointing to rebel leaders such as <e10>Shamil </e10><e10>Basayev </e10>and the <e5>Jordanian-born </e5><e6>Omar </e6><e6>Ibn </e6><e6>al </e6><e6>Khattab </e6>, who are believed to have financial and other ties to <e7>Osama </e7><e7>bin </e7><e7>Laden </e7>'s <e14>al-Qaida </e14>terrorist network . <br><blue>7</blue>However , U.S. officials also note that some of the rebels do not have international ties , and they have criticized <e8>Russian </e8>military and police abuse of civilians -- although the criticism was toned down greatly after <e8>Russia </e8>became an enthusiastic member of the anti-terrorist coalition , sharing intelligence information , opening its airspace to humanitarian flights and giving a green light to <e12>U.S. </e12>military deployment in <e0>Central </e0><e0>Asia </e0>. <br><blue>8</blue>The <e4>Foreign </e4><e4>Ministry </e4>said that the <e11>State </e11><e11>Department </e11>pronouncement on <e2>Chechnya </e2>reflected the efforts of `` certain circles '' in the <e12>United </e12><e12>States </e12>that object to the new U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism . <br><blue>9</blue>`` These circles have persistently tried to reanimate the ` <e1>Chechen </e1>problem , ' and turn it again into an irritant in the <e9>Russian-American </e9>dialogue , '' the ministry said . <br><blue>10</blue>The ministry also suggested that before judging others ' rights records , the <e12>United </e12><e12>States </e12>should investigate the situation at home , including the government 's failure to ratify some international human rights agreements and the use of the death penalty . <br><blue>11</blue><e8>Russia </e8>introduced a moratorium on capital punishment , a prerequisite for joining the <e3>Council </e3><e3>of </e3><e3>Europe </e3>, in 1996 . <br></div>
