<blue>1</blue>NEW TREATMENT FOR CANCER FOUND TO WORK IN ANIMALS . <br><blue>2</blue>A new method of attacking cancer cells , developed by researchers in <e0>Australia </e0>, has proved surprisingly effective in animal tests . <br><blue>3</blue>The method is intended to sidestep two major drawbacks of standard chemotherapy : the treatment 's lack of specificity and the fact that cancer cells often develop resistance . <br><blue>4</blue>In one striking use of the method , reported online Sunday in <e8>Nature </e8><e8>Biotechnology </e8>, mice were implanted with a human uterine tumor that was highly aggressive and resistant to many drugs . <br><blue>5</blue>All of the treated animals were free of tumor cells after 70 days of treatment ; the untreated mice were dead after a month . <br><blue>6</blue><e4><eC>The </eC></e4><e4><eC>lead </eC></e4><e4><eC>researchers </eC></e4>, <e4><eC>Dr. </eC></e4><e4><eC>Jennifer </eC></e4><e4><eC>A. </eC></e4><e4><eC>MacDiarmid </eC></e4><e4><eC>and </eC></e4><e4><eC>Dr. </eC></e4><e3>Himanshu </e3><e3>Brahmbhatt </e3>, say <e4><eC>their </eC></e4>company , EnGeneIC of suburban <e10>Sydney </e10>, has achieved a similar outcome in dogs with advanced brain cancer . <br><blue>7</blue>`` <e4><eC>We </eC></e4>have been treating more than 20 dogs and have spectacular results , '' <e3>Brahmbhatt </e3>said . <br><blue>8</blue>`` Pretty much every dog has responded , and some are in remission . '' <br><blue>9</blue>These experiments have not yet been published . <br><blue>10</blue>Cancer experts who were not involved with the research say that the new method is of great interest , but that many treatments that work well in laboratory mice turn out to be ineffective in patients . <br><blue>11</blue><e1>Bert </e1><e1>Vogelstein </e1>, <e1><eC>a </eC></e1><e1><eC>leading </eC></e1>cancer <e1><eC>researcher </eC></e1><e1><eC>at </eC></e1><e1><eC>Johns </eC></e1><e1><eC>Hopkins </eC></e1><e1><eC>University </eC></e1>, called the method `` a creative and promising line of research , '' but noted the general odds against success . <br><blue>12</blue>`` Unfortunately , our track record shows that far less than 1 percent of our promising approaches actually make the grade in patients , '' <e1><eC>he </eC></e1>said . <br><blue>13</blue>The <e2>EnGeneIC </e2>researchers said they had conducted successful safety tests in a large number of monkeys and will start safety trials in patients with all kinds of solid tumors in three <e6>Melbourne </e6>hospitals next month . <br><blue>14</blue>They said they had discussed licensing their technology with large pharmaceutical companies and others . <br><blue>15</blue>Dr. <e9>Stephen </e9><e9>H. </e9><e9>Friend </e9>, head of cancer research at <e7>Merck </e7>until early this year , said <e9><eC>he </eC></e9>had been following EnGeneIC 's work for more than a year , and praised the company for trying a method that others had written off without trying . <br></div>
