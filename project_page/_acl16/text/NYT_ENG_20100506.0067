'' <br><blue>10</blue>As with many books-turned-musicals , the art of creating `` <e0><eC>The </eC></e0><e0><eC>Kid </eC></e0>'' was one of fits and starts , with initially important characters like <e2>Dan </e2>'s father ultimately cast aside and the depiction of the baby 's mother -- a homeless teenager named <e4>Melissa </e4>-- carefully considered and reconsidered . <br><blue>11</blue>Aiming to appeal to a wide audience , the creators also wrestled with how explicitly to render both the graphically sexual jokes in the book and the politics of gay adoption , which the creators -- most of them gay men -- did not want to shy away from in the musical . <br><blue>12</blue>`` One of the great parts of the book was that it was political without being political , that it tells a story of two guys creating a family without having to shove the politics of that experience in <e1>America </e1>down audience members ' throats , '' said <e6>Scott </e6><e6>Elliott </e6>, <e6><eC>the </eC></e6><e6><eC>director </eC></e6><e6><eC>of </eC></e6><e6><eC>the </eC></e6><e6><eC>musical </eC></e6>and the artistic director of the <e5>New </e5><e5>Group </e5>. <br><blue>13</blue>`` But we were also conscious of the delicacy of turning a popular book , particularly one man 's deeply felt memoir , into a piece of theater . '' <br><blue>14</blue>For every book that has successfully inspired a musical , like `` Les Miserables , '' `` The Phantom of the Opera '' and `` Wicked , '' there are many more musicals that have met with mixed results in trying to faithfully adapt the sprawling plot , subplots and array of characters from popular novels . <br><blue>15</blue>Recent musicals like `` A Tale of Two Cities , '' `` High Fidelity , '' `` <e3>James </e3><e3>Joyce </e3>'s the Dead , '' `` Ragtime '' and `` The Color Purple '' sought in various ways to pack a novel 's worth of ambitions into two-and-a-half-hour shows ; in response , theater critics often judged the shows to be overstuffed . <br></div>
