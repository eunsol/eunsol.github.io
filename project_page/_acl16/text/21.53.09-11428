<blue>1</blue><e1>Amman </e1>-- <e6>Jordan </e6>, bound by environmental clauses in the <e4>Free </e4><e4>Trade </e4><e4>Agreement </e4>-LRB- <e4>FTA </e4>-RRB- with the <e10>US </e10>, is currently mulling over signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming even though <e11>Washington </e11>turned down the protocol six months ago . <br><blue>2</blue>Having clauses on the protection of environmental and labour rights in the body of <e4><eC>the </eC></e4><e4><eC>FTA </eC></e4>does not stop the government from signing environmental agreements refused by the <e10>US </e10>, according to Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment <e0>Abdul </e0><e0>Razzaq </e0><e0>Tbeishat </e0>. <br><blue>3</blue>He explained to The <e6>Jordan </e6><e6>Times </e6>that `` in <e6>Jordan </e6>, we conclusively believe that development can not be achieved unless the environment is protected . '' <br><blue>4</blue>Certain steps have to be taken with regard to this objective -- including signing the <e8>Kyoto </e8>deal , he said . <br><blue>5</blue>He announced the government 's intentions to sign the <e8>Kyoto </e8>treaty on Sunday during a workshop on climate change , organised by the ministry and the <e9>United </e9><e9>Nations </e9><e9>Development </e9><e9>Programme </e9>-LRB- <e9>UNDP </e9>-RRB- . <br><blue>6</blue>In 1992 , <e6>Jordan </e6>signed the <e9>UN </e9>Climate Change Convention that compels nations to curb global warming , which is blamed on gases produced by factories and cars that burn fuel . <br><blue>7</blue>The <e8>Kyoto </e8>climate treaty is another international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming . <br><blue>8</blue>Asked whether signing the Kyoto Protocol will affect <e6><eC>Jordan </eC></e6>and <e10>US </e10>efforts to upgrade the <e7>Kingdom </e7>'s environmental framework , Tbeishat said that signing the protocol will have a `` positive '' outcome on <e6>Jordan </e6>. <br><blue>9</blue>He explained that both the <e10>US </e10>and <e6>Jordan </e6>have different issues to deal with on a national level , including environmental issues . <br><blue>10</blue>`` In the <e10>US </e10>, they have their own circumstances , '' <e10><eC>the </eC></e10><e10><eC>minister </eC></e10>said . <br><blue>11</blue>`` But here , we are a developing country and we care about having clean industry ... the whole world knows our position , -LSB- which is -RSB- to achieve sustainable development . '' <br><blue>12</blue>The <e8>Kyoto </e8><e8>Protocol </e8>was agreed upon by 160 countries under the <e9>United </e9><e9>Nations </e9>Framework Convention on Climate Change -LRB- UNFCCC -RRB- . <br><blue>13</blue>The convention was created in 1992 , and adopted in <e8><eC>Kyoto </eC></e8><e8><eC>, </eC></e8><e5>Japan </e5><e8><eC>Japan </eC></e8>, in 1997 . <br><blue>14</blue>Under the agreement , industrialised nations must reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2 per cent -LRB- from 1990 levels -RRB- from between 2008 to 2012 . <br><blue>15</blue>After the <e3>Clinton </e3>administration signed the Kyoto Protocol in November 1998 , the new <e2>Bush </e2>administration overturned the decision last April , as the <e10>US </e10>was facing a faltering economy and rising energy prices . <br></div>
