<blue>1</blue>On March 4 , the <e6>US </e6>State Depart-ment released its annual human rights report . <br><blue>2</blue>Apart from criticizing the `` axis of evil '' countries for abusing human rights , it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti-terrorist alliance . <br><blue>3</blue>What is most interesting about the reports is the section on <e3>Israel </e3>. <br><blue>4</blue>Since <e3>Israel </e3>suffers from terrorist attacks , the report says , <e3><eC>it </eC></e3>has been forced to take counter-terrorism measures , making <e3><eC>its </eC></e3>rights abuses understandable . <br><blue>5</blue>What 's more , post-Sept . <br><blue>6</blue>11 restrictions in the <e6>US </e6>on entering and leaving the country and on air travel , as well as measures curbing the civil rights of accused persons , are not discussed at all . <br><blue>7</blue>The report is generally quite frank and its wording strong , but it proposes no corrective action . <br><blue>8</blue>Consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overshadowing concerns about human rights . <br><blue>9</blue>In exchange for support for its war on terror , the <e6>US </e6>is tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by other members of the anti-terror coalition . <br><blue>10</blue>The most glaring examples are <e5>Russia </e5>'s suppression of resis-tance to its rule in <e0>Chechnya </e0>, <e1>China </e1>'s suppression of independence advocates in <e7>Xinjiang </e7>and the <e2>Falun </e2><e2>Gong </e2>movement , and <e3><eC>Israel </eC></e3><e3><eC>'s </eC></e3>treatment of <e4>Palestinians </e4>. <br><blue>11</blue><e6>US </e6>activities , meanwhile , show no sign of promoting the universal values of democracy , human rights and peace . <br><blue>12</blue>Six months have passed since Sept. 11 and the focus of <e6>US </e6>anger has turned to countries that have been labeled `` rogue nations '' and members of an `` axis of evil . '' <br><blue>13</blue>The <e6>US </e6>anti-terrorist alliance has become the embodiment of two-sided justice . <br><blue>14</blue>`` If you 're not with us , you 're against us . '' <br><blue>15</blue>The human rights report poses a substantial challenge to the <e6>US </e6>interpretation of good and evil . <br></div>
