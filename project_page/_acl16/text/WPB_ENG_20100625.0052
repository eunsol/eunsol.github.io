<blue>1</blue><e3>Consumer </e3><e3>Financial </e3><e3>Protection </e3>. <br><blue>2</blue>A consumer financial-protection bureau will be created at the <e4>Federal </e4><e4>Reserve </e4>to police banks and financial-services businesses for credit-card and mortgage - lending abuses . <br><blue>3</blue>The plan was approved over the objections of <e7>Republicans </e7>and the financial industry . <br><blue>4</blue><e6>Obama </e6>originally proposed a stand-alone consumer agency , saying it would play a central role in reorganizing regulation to prevent future financial crises . <br><blue>5</blue>`` It 's an agency with considerable authority to protect consumers from abusive financial practices , which is a landmark achievement , '' <e9>Travis </e9><e9>Plunkett </e9>, legislative director at the <e2>Consumer </e2><e2>Federation </e2><e2>of </e2><e2>America </e2>, said in an interview . <br><blue>6</blue>While the bureau will be housed at the <e4>Fed </e4>, it will have independent authority . <br><blue>7</blue>Led by a director appointed by the president and confirmed by the <e8>Senate </e8>, the bureau will write consumer-protection rules for banks and other firms that offer financial services or products . <br><blue>8</blue><e8><eC>It </eC></e8>will enforce those rules for banks and credit unions with more than $ 10 billion in assets . <br><blue>9</blue>Bank regulators will continue examining consumer practices at smaller financial institutions . <br><blue>10</blue>The bureau could require credit-card lenders , including <e5>JPMorgan </e5><e5>Chase </e5><e5>& </e5><e5>Co. </e5>and <e1>Citigroup </e1>, to reduce interest rates and fees . <br><blue>11</blue>Mortgage lenders , including <e0>Bank </e0><e0>of </e0><e0>America </e0>, may be subject to tougher rules including more upfront disclosures to borrowers about loan terms . <br><blue>12</blue>Automobile dealers won an exemption from oversight by the bureau after lobbying from the industry . <br><blue>13</blue>Dealers said the rules would place unnecessary restrictions on their financing business . <br><blue>14</blue>The <e6>Obama </e6>administration had opposed the exemption . <br><blue>15</blue>The idea for a new agency grew out of criticism from lawmakers and consumer groups that bank regulators , including the <e4>Fed </e4>, failed to properly exercise their consumer-protection authority during the housing boom . <br></div>
