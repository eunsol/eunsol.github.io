<blue>1</blue>Regular <e3>British </e3>troops will not be sent to fight the <e9>Taliban </e9>, <e4>Robin </e4><e4>Cook </e4>signalled tonight . <br><blue>2</blue><e4><eC>His </eC></e4>remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of <e5>Kandahar </e5>after <e7>Northern </e7><e7>Alliance </e7>troops finally entered <e6>Kunduz </e6>. <br><blue>3</blue><e8>SAS </e8>-LSB- <e8>Special </e8><e8>Air </e8><e8>Service </e8>-RSB- soldiers and their <e2>American </e2>counterparts are fighting alongside <e7><eC>the </eC></e7><e7><eC>Alliance </eC></e7>as they have swept across large swathes <e1>Afghanistan </e1>. <br><blue>4</blue>But Commons Leader Mr <e4>Cook </e4>said : `` If you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put <e3>British </e3>troops into the ground civil war and I do n't myself imagine that 's going to change . '' <br><blue>5</blue><e3>British </e3>troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was `` better than anybody could have hoped for '' , according to Mr <e4>Cook </e4>. <br><blue>6</blue>`` We will continue obviously to keep the situation under review , but frankly , I think we should welcome the fact that their presence has not been needed in <e1>Afghanistan </e1>. <br><blue>7</blue>This is not a reverse , it 's actually an advance , '' he added . <br><blue>8</blue>News of the <e5>Kandahar </e5>negotiations came after the <e9>Taliban </e9>control crumbled in their final northern stronghold of <e6>Kunduz </e6>following mass surrender . <br><blue>9</blue>The city 's top <e9>Taliban </e9>commander was among thousands of <e0>Afghan </e0>and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting . <br><blue>10</blue>However , night fell before <e7><eC>the </eC></e7><e7><eC>Alliance </eC></e7>could secure the city , increasing the danger of militants fighting back . <br><blue>11</blue>Hours after the vanguard entered from the west , a tank column halted its advance from the east , fearing hostile fire . <br><blue>12</blue>The surrender took days to hammer out , primarily because hard <e9><eC>core </eC></e9><e9><eC>Taliban </eC></e9>and foreign troops from <e10>Usama </e10><e10>Bin </e10><e10>Ladin </e10>'s al-Qa ` ida terror network did not want to give up . <br><blue>13</blue>The fall of <e6>Kunduz </e6>leaves <e5>Kandahar </e5>as the <e9>Taliban </e9>'s last major stronghold following the rapid collapse of their regime across the majority of the country . <br><blue>14</blue>Hundreds of foreign fighters captured in the siege of the northern city were killed in a prison riot at a fortress outside <e0>Mazar-e-Sharif </e0>, <e7><eC>the </eC></e7><e7><eC>Northern </eC></e7><e7><eC>Alliance </eC></e7>said . <br><blue>15</blue>But that did not stop <e9>Taliban </e9>commanders discussing the surrender of <e5>Kandahar </e5>, following calls from 70 <e0>Afghan </e0>tribal leaders for them to avert bloodshed . <br></div>
