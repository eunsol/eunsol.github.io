<blue>1</blue>-LSB- `` Opinion '' <e9>U.S. </e9>Human Rights Claims Only Empty Rhetoric -RSB- The <e10>U.S. </e10><e10>State </e10><e10>Department </e10>on Monday published its annual report on the status of human rights in other countries in the year 2001 . <br><blue>2</blue>In this report , when referring to <e5>Iran </e5>, the <e9>United </e9><e9>States </e9>repeated its allegations against the <e5>Islamic </e5><e5>Republic </e5>but failed to provide any evidence in support of its baseless charges . <br><blue>3</blue>Among the unfounded allegations was the claim that the <e5>Islamic </e5><e5>Republic </e5>enjoys no social base and is an unpopular system because of its human rights violations . <br><blue>4</blue>However , the massive participation of millions of <e5>Iranians </e5>in the grand rallies on Feb. 11 to mark the anniversary of the victory of the <e6>Islamic </e6><e6>Revolution </e6>and defy U.S. threats against this country once again revealed the emptiness of <e9>U.S. </e9>charges against <e5>Iran </e5>. <br><blue>5</blue>It is quite clear that such baseless accusations are only made to tarnish the image of <e5>Iran </e5>, since it follows an independent policy and refuses to bow to <e9>U.S. </e9>domination . <br><blue>6</blue>It is interesting that the <e10>U.S. </e10><e10>State </e10><e10>Department </e10>'s annual global human rights report came this year at a time when <e11>Washington </e11>itself is being sharply criticized by most countries and international human rights organizations for the killing of a large number of innocent civilians in <e0>Afghanistan </e0>and the torture and inhuman treatment of the <e7>Taleban </e7>and <e2>Al-Qaeda </e2>prisoners at its military base at <e4>Guantanamo </e4><e4>Bay </e4>. <br><blue>7</blue>Indeed , the <e8>U.S </e8><e8>Administration </e8>, which claims to advocate international human rights issues and which tries to play the role of a world policeman , is actually condoning the most atrocious human rights violations committed in the <e9>United </e9><e9>States </e9><e8><eC>itself </eC></e8>. <br><blue>8</blue>The ugliest crimes are perpetrated against inmates in U.S. prisons , and the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by the <e9>U.S. </e9>police is so appalling that on several occasions <e8><eC>it </eC></e8>has led to massive riots . <br><blue>9</blue>For instance , a bloody riot was ignited in <e3>Cincinnati </e3>when an <e1>Afro-American </e1>youth was shot dead for no reason by police officers . <br><blue>10</blue>Although the <e9>United </e9><e9>States </e9>claims to advocate human rights , its harsh treatment of its own citizens and its hegemonic and belligerent policy towards other nations prove that the claim is just empty rhetoric . <br></div>
