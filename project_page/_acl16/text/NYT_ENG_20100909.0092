<blue>1</blue>BC-STILLREVIEW-DET . <br><blue>2</blue>` Still Here ' should take a hike -- it 's a bore By <e6>Tom </e6><e6>Long </e6><e3>Detroit </e3><e3>News </e3><e3>Film </e3>Critic It does n't really matter whether <e4>Joaquin </e4><e4>Phoenix </e4>is playing a role or being <e4><eC>himself </eC></e4>in the perhaps-faux documentary `` I 'm Still Here . '' <br><blue>3</blue>Either way his character is obnoxious and <e3><eC>the </eC></e3><e3><eC>film </eC></e3>is mostly a bore . <br><blue>4</blue><e5><eC>Phoenix </eC></e5><e5><eC>-LRB- </eC></e5><e5><eC>`` </eC></e5><e5><eC>Gladiator </eC></e5><e5><eC>, </eC></e5><e5><eC>'' </eC></e5>'' Walk the Line '' -RRB- announced a few years back that he was quitting acting to become a hip-hop musician . <br><blue>5</blue>Then he famously showed up on `` Late Night with <e2>David </e2><e2>Letterman </e2>'' sporting a long beard and hair and acting semi-comatose . <br><blue>6</blue>When news leaked that <e0>Casey </e0><e0>Affleck </e0>, <e0><eC>Phoenix </eC></e0><e0><eC>'s </eC></e0><e0><eC>brother-in-law </eC></e0>, was shooting a film documenting <e5><eC>Phoenix </eC></e5><e5><eC>'s </eC></e5>transformation , rumors began swirling that the whole thing was a put-on . <br><blue>7</blue><e5><eC>That </eC></e5>seems to be the truth , since both <e0>Affleck </e0>and <e5>Phoenix </e5>take writing credits on `` <e0><eC>I </eC></e0>'m Still Here . '' <br><blue>8</blue>Beyond <e5><eC>that </eC></e5>, <e5><eC>it </eC></e5>'s hard to conceive of anyone releasing a real self-portrait this negative . <br><blue>9</blue><e5>Phoenix </e5>is seen cavorting with prostitutes , viciously berating assistants , taking copious amounts of drugs and rambling incoherently . <br><blue>10</blue>In fact , he rarely rambles coherently , and most of what he says makes him sound like a spoiled , arrogant jerk . <br><blue>11</blue>Of course , this is probably just the character ; but who wants to watch a spoiled , arrogant jerk even if it is just a character ? <br><blue>12</blue>If the entire enterprise is supposed to say something about the <e1>American </e1>preoccupation with celebrity or the decadence of show business brats , well , those already overdone subjects have been covered better elsewhere . <br><blue>13</blue>And by the way , if <e5>Phoenix </e5>is actually retiring from acting for a music career , he 's bound for disaster . <br><blue>14</blue>The guy has no discernable talent and he 's terrible on stage . <br><blue>15</blue>But chances are the joke is on us . <br></div>
