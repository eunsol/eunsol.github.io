'' <br><blue>6</blue>But after a year in which <e5><eC>Reid </eC></e5>has been at the top of every list of endangered <e1>Democrats </e1>-- there is no one Republicans would like more to unseat -- <e5>Reid </e5>sees a lifeline in Angle , a former state assemblywoman who , with the backing of the <e10>Tea </e10><e10>Party </e10>, overcame a field of establishment <e6>Republicans </e6>to win <e10><eC>the </eC></e10><e10><eC>party </eC></e10><e10><eC>'s </eC></e10>nomination . <br><blue>7</blue>Since Angle won , her campaign has been rocked by a series of politically intemperate remarks and awkward efforts to retreat from hard-line positions she has embraced in the past , like phasing out <e9>Social </e9><e9>Security </e9>. <br><blue>8</blue>There has also been a staff shakeup and run-ins with <e4>Nevada </e4>journalists . <br><blue>9</blue><e6>Republicans </e6>in this state are concerned that what had once seemed a relatively easily victory is suddenly in doubt , with signs that Angle 's campaign is scrambling to regroup . <br><blue>10</blue>Angle 's primary victory was a testimony to the power of the <e10>Tea </e10><e10>Party </e10>. <br><blue>11</blue>And if she wins in November , it will have huge national implications : A <e10>Tea </e10><e10>Party </e10>candidate will have taken down the most powerful member of the <e7>Senate </e7>and a close ally and friend of President <e0>Barack </e0><e0>Obama </e0>. <br><blue>12</blue>But some of her conservative positions could prove a hurdle come November . <br><blue>13</blue>She has , for example , called for the elimination of the <e2>Energy </e2><e2>Department </e2>and the <e3>Environmental </e3><e3>Protection </e3><e3>Agency </e3>, denounced the BP compensation fund for victims of the oil spill as a slush fund , and suggested that her candidacy was a mission for God . <br><blue>14</blue>In recent days , there have been a number of events that suggest Angle is trying to change the way she is doing things . <br><blue>15</blue>The interview itself was a break from past practice , and after that , she took a few questions from reporters at a brief news conference . <br></div>
