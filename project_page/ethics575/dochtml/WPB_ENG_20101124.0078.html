'' <br><blue>5</blue>The report , which has sparked debate across the <e3>Internet </e3>, taps into the continuing potency of social issues , such as same-sex marriage , in <e0>American </e0>politics . <br><blue>6</blue>Several of the groups described in the report supported a successful effort to oust <e8><eC>state </eC></e8><e8><eC>Supreme </eC></e8><e8><eC>Court </eC></e8>judges in <e4>Iowa </e4>because of a unanimous ruling last year that legalized same-sex unions . <br><blue>7</blue><e2><eC>The </eC></e2><e2><eC>Family </eC></e2><e2><eC>Research </eC></e2><e2><eC>Council </eC></e2>has been at the forefront of political activism against same-sex marriage . <br><blue>8</blue>In explaining the decision to put the council on its hate-groups list , the law center highlighted comments by <e6>Peter </e6><e6>Sprigg </e6>, <e6><eC>a </eC></e6><e6><eC>senior </eC></e6><e6><eC>fellow </eC></e6><e6><eC>for </eC></e6><e6><eC>policy </eC></e6><e6><eC>studies </eC></e6>at the council , who told <e5>MSNBC </e5>host <e1>Chris </e1><e1>Matthews </e1>this year that he thinks `` homosexual behavior '' should be outlawed . <br><blue>9</blue>Council President <e9>Tony </e9><e9>Perkins </e9>, who was also named in the report , called the hate-group designation a political attack by a `` liberal organization . '' <br><blue>10</blue>`` The left 's smear campaign of conservatives is ... being driven by the clear evidence that the <e0>American </e0>public is losing patience with their radical policy agenda as seen in the recent election and in the fact that every state ... that has had the opportunity to defend the natural definition of marriage has done so , '' <e9>Perkins </e9>said in a statement . <br><blue>11</blue>`` Earlier this month , voters in <e4>Iowa </e4>sent a powerful message when they removed three <e8>Supreme </e8><e8>Court </e8>justices who imposed same-sex marriage on the state . <br><blue>12</blue>Would the <e7>SPLC </e7>also smear the good people of <e4>Iowa </e4>? '' <br><blue>13</blue>The law center said it chose to highlight the groups on the list `` based on their propagation of known falsehoods '' and `` repeated , groundless name-calling . '' <br><blue>14</blue>`` Viewing homosexuality as unbiblical does not qualify organizations for listing as hate groups , '' the report said . <br><blue>15</blue>The debate over the list has focused on whether the law center is right to equate anti-gay views with racism . <br></div>
