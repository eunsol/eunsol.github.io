<blue>1</blue>Sir Stephen Spender , the British poet , critic and novelist , died yesterday at St. Mary 's Hospital in London . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 86 . <br><blue>3</blue>He had been taken to the hospital after collapsing at his home in north London , a spokesman for the hospital said . <br><blue>4</blue>In the 1930 's , Stephen Spender was one of a small group of young poets who transformed English letters by insisting that poetry be linked to political and social concerns and other aspects of the larger world . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Spender drew wide attention in 1930 , when his " Twenty Poems " was published ; two years later , some of his poems and those by W. H. Auden , C. Day Lewis and others were included in an anthology , " New Signatures , " published by Leonard and Virginia Woolf 's Hogarth Press . <br><blue>6</blue>Along with Mr. Spender , Auden , Louis MacNeice and a few others came to be known as the Oxford poets , since they had all studied there around the same time . <br><blue>7</blue>Sometimes Mr. Spender was described as " Shelleyan " because of the fervor of his call for sweeping change and of his lyrical way with words . <br><blue>8</blue>Because of that lyricism , coupled with his good looks , he was also once labeled " the Rupert Brooke of the Depression , " in a barbed reference to the British war poet who died during World War I . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Spender often wrote about the world around him -- which he saw with sorrow and anger . <br><blue>10</blue>In 1934 , he wrote a long narrative poem , " Vienna , " about a recent Socialist uprising in that city . <br><blue>11</blue>In " The Landscape Near an Aerodrome " he wrote about just that , almost lovingly describing the descent of a plane with " furred antennae feeling its huge path / Through dusk . " <br><blue>12</blue>Later , during World War II , he wrote of his feelings about politics in a series of articles on " Books and the War . " <br><blue>13</blue>He began one article with these words : " We are living in a political age . <br><blue>14</blue>That is to say political beliefs and events play a part in the lives of contemporaries which religious and spectacular warnings of the working out of doom amongst the great used to play in the past . <br><blue>15</blue>" Poets are faced , then , with the problem of transforming into the comprehensive terms of the imagination the chaos of this politically obsessed world . " <br><blue>16</blue>Amid " shattering material events , such as wars and revolutions , " he wrote , " the problem is to understand the nature of these events and transform them into a lucid language of the imagination , where they exist in their own right , coherent visions independent of reality , but nevertheless reflecting the truth of reality . " <br><blue>17</blue>Although Mr. Spender 's poetry won less renown than his friend Auden 's , his work has been widely anthologized . <br><blue>18</blue>Earlier , in the late 1920 's , Mr. MacNeice described Mr. Spender as " redeeming the world by introspection , " and he remained involved with the world and its continuing need for redemption in his poetry and prose , as critic and commentator . <br><blue>19</blue>And his poems appeared widely in anthologies , though he gained less worldly renown than did his friend Auden . <br><blue>20</blue>Oxford Friendships , Wartime Politics Stephen Harold Spender was born on Feb. 28 , 1909 in London , into a family that was in comfortable but not , according to his autobiography , particularly happy circumstances . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the problem of transforming into the comprehensive terms of the imagination the chaos of this politically obsessed world</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>the problem</m_str> (16_18) 	<br><blue>2(5)</blue>: <m_str>material events</m_str> (16_4) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (16_40) 	<m_str>these events</m_str> (16_26) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (16_43) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (16_30) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (1_21) 	<m_str>north London</m_str> (3_14) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (20_17) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>St. Mary 's Hospital in London</m_str> (1_16) 	<m_str>the hospital</m_str> (3_20) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>1930 's</m_str> (4_3) 	<m_str>1930</m_str> (5_7) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>world</m_str> (15_26) 	<m_str>the world</m_str> (18_17) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>his poems</m_str> (5_24) 	<m_str>his poems</m_str> (19_2) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>his friend Auden 's</m_str> (17_10) 	<m_str>his friend Auden</m_str> (19_17) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Auden , Louis MacNeice and a few others</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (6_24) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Spender 's poetry</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>his poetry</m_str> (18_37) 	<br><blue>11(1)</blue>: <m_str>World War II</m_str> (12_4) 	<br><blue>12(1)</blue>: <m_str>his work</m_str> (17_15) 	<br><blue>13(34)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>Stephen Spender</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Spender</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_24) 	<m_str>Mr. Spender</m_str> (6_3) 	<m_str>Mr. Spender</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_22) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Spender</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Spender 's</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>Mr. MacNeice</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Spender</m_str> (18_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_37) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_17) 	<m_str>Oxford Friendships , Wartime Politics Stephen Harold Spender</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_31) 	<br><blue>14(1)</blue>: <m_str>Oxford</m_str> (6_20) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>an Aerodrome</m_str> (11_6) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (11_28) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
