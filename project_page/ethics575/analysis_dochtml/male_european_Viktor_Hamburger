<blue>1</blue>Viktor Hamburger , an experimental embryologist who mapped much of the delicate pas de deux executed by the developing nervous system and the tissue it controls , died on Tuesday in St. Louis . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 100 years old and lived in nearby University City . <br><blue>3</blue>Dr. Hamburger , who spent much of his career as a professor at Washington University , was born soon after embryology had grown into an experimental science from a mainly observational pursuit . <br><blue>4</blue>His death comes as much of classical experimental embryology , which focuses on tissues and cells , is being supplanted by strategies that look at the interactions of molecules in the embryo . '' <br><blue>5</blue>It is given to relatively few to be so totally identified with a scientific endeavor , '' said Dr. W. Maxwell Cowan , then vice president and chief scientific officer at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , in his introduction to '' Studies in Developmental Neurobiology : Essays in Honor of Viktor Hamburger '' ( Oxford University Press , 1981 ) . <br><blue>6</blue>As a leading experimental embryologist throughout the field 's heyday , Dr. Hamburger discovered some of the basic principles that govern development across many species . <br><blue>7</blue>He also tried to call attention to the unanswered questions of classical embryology so that younger scientists could use the power of molecular biology to go where he could not . <br><blue>8</blue>Dr. Hamburger and his colleagues figured out that the architecture of the nervous system depends as much on which nerve cells die as it does on which cells are born , and they determined many of the rules for predicting the cellular winners and losers . <br><blue>9</blue>Scientists already knew about the one-way chemical and electrical traffic from a nerve cell to a muscle or other target tissue , but Dr. Hamburger 's laboratory determined that the traffic was two-way . <br><blue>10</blue>Target tissues produce sustaining chemicals , called trophic factors , which are picked up by the spidery processes of the nerve cells , influencing the life-and-death competition among the neurons . <br><blue>11</blue>That fundamental finding spun off a new area of research that attracted many scientists . <br><blue>12</blue>The first trophic factor , a protein called nerve growth factor , or N.G.F. , was discovered in Dr. Hamburger 's laboratory . <br><blue>13</blue>He collaborated on the biology of the factor with Dr. Rita Levi-Montalcini ; a biochemist , Dr. Stanley Cohen , joined the project to isolate the protein , which was done in 1954 . '' <br><blue>14</blue>N.G.F. was really the link between the 1930 's and 40 's and the modern age of molecular neuroscience , '' said Dr. Dale Purves , chairman of the neurobiology department at Duke University . <br><blue>15</blue>The concept of trophic factors , and of how they affect the competition for survival among neurons , he said , would have been considered '' an enormous contribution to the canon of neuroscience , '' even if nerve growth factor itself had never been found . <br><blue>16</blue>Dr. Hamburger moved on to the study of the origin of behavior in the early 1960 's . <br><blue>17</blue>He found that chick embryos moved in predictable ways as they developed , until they finally broke out of their shells , and that those movements were spontaneous . <br><blue>18</blue>That discovery contradicted the contentions of behavioral psychologists , who said all behavior arose from stimuli or reflexes . <br><blue>19</blue>Dr. Ron Oppenheim , a professor of neurobiology at Wake Forest University Medical School who worked on the embryonic behavior experiments with Dr. Hamburger , said , '' It was an unexpected finding and revived a field that nobody had been working in for 30 years . '' <br><blue>20</blue>But Dr. Hamburger 's detour from the nerve growth factor work may have been a costly decision . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (8_24) 	<m_str>the architecture of the nervous system</m_str> (8_9) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (15_19) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Dale Purves , chairman of the neurobiology department at Duke University</m_str> (14_23) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>the field 's</m_str> (6_7) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>the developing nervous system</m_str> (1_18) 	<m_str>the nervous system</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (1_25) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (17_20) 	<m_str>chick embryos</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (17_11) 	<br><blue>6(5)</blue>: <m_str>Viktor Hamburger</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Viktor Hamburger</m_str> (5_52) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_8) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the nerve cells</m_str> (10_20) 	<m_str>nerve cells</m_str> (8_20) 	<br><blue>8(9)</blue>: <m_str>Dr. Hamburger</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>Forest University Medical School who worked on the embryonic behavior experiments with Dr. Hamburger</m_str> (19_11) 	<m_str>Dr. Hamburger</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Hamburger 's</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>Dr. Hamburger</m_str> (19_23) 	<m_str>Dr. Hamburger 's</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>Dr. Hamburger 's</m_str> (9_24) 	<m_str>Dr. Hamburger</m_str> (6_12) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>It</m_str> (19_29) 	<m_str>That discovery</m_str> (18_1) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>The first trophic factor , a protein called nerve growth factor , or N.G.F.</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>the factor</m_str> (13_7) 	<br><blue>11(1)</blue>: <m_str>the nerve growth factor work</m_str> (20_7) 	<br><blue>12(1)</blue>: <m_str>St. Louis</m_str> (1_32) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>Dr. Hamburger 's laboratory</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>Dr. Hamburger 's laboratory</m_str> (9_24) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>N.G.F.</m_str> (12_14) 	<m_str>N.G.F.</m_str> (14_1) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>nerve growth factor itself</m_str> (15_39) 	<m_str>itself</m_str> (15_42) 	<br><blue>16(2)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>17(2)</blue>: <m_str>trophic factors</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (15_10) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
