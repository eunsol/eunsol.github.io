<blue>1</blue>Thurgood Marshall , pillar of the civil rights revolution , architect of the legal strategy that ended the era of official segregation and the first black Justice of the Supreme Court , died today . <br><blue>2</blue>A major figure in American public life for a half-century , he was 84 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>Toni House , the Court 's spokeswoman , said Justice Marshall died of heart failure at Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Maryland at 2 P.M. Justice Marshall , who retired from the High Court in 1991 , had been scheduled to administer the oath of office to Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday , but his failing health prevented him from doing so . <br><blue>4</blue>Thurgood Marshall was a figure of history well before he began his 24-year service on the Supreme Court on Oct. 2 , 1967 . <br><blue>5</blue>During more than 20 years as director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , he was the principal architect of the strategy of using the courts to provide what the political system would not : a definition of equality that assured black Americans the full rights of citizenship . <br><blue>6</blue>Landmark Triumph in 1954 His greatest legal victory came in 1954 with the Supreme Court 's decision in Brown v. Board of Education , which declared an end to the " separate but equal " system of racial segregation then in effect in the public schools of 21 states . <br><blue>7</blue>Despite the years of turmoil that followed the unanimous decision , the Court left no doubt that it was bringing an end to the era of official segregation in all public institutions . <br><blue>8</blue>Many questions lingered after so monumental a transformation , and the Court continued to confront issues involving the legacy of segregation even after Justice Marshall retired . <br><blue>9</blue>As a civil rights lawyer , Mr. Marshall devised the legal strategy and headed the team that brought the school desegregation issue before the Court . <br><blue>10</blue>An experienced Supreme Court advocate by that time , he argued the case himself in the straightforward , plain-spoken manner that was the hallmark of his courtroom style . <br><blue>11</blue>Asked by Justice Felix Frankfurter during the argument what he meant by " equal , " Mr. Marshall replied , " Equal means getting the same thing , at the same time , and in the same place . " <br><blue>12</blue>He won many other important civil rights cases , including a challenge to the whites-only primary elections in Texas . <br><blue>13</blue>This device was commonly used by white Southern politicians to disenfranchise blacks . <br><blue>14</blue>He also won a major Supreme Court case in which the Court declared that restrictive covenants that barred blacks from buying or renting homes could not be enforced in state courts . <br><blue>15</blue>' Heroic Imagination ' In a Ruthless World Mr. Marshall , who was born and reared in Baltimore , was excluded from the all-white law school at the University of Maryland . <br><blue>16</blue>Later he brought successful lawsuits that integrated not only that school but also several other state university systems . <br><blue>17</blue>He received his legal education at the law school of Howard University in Washington , D.C. , the nation 's pre-eminent black university , where he graduated first in his class in 1933 and made the personal and intellectual connections that shaped his future career . <br><blue>18</blue>Years later , the University of Maryland named its law library for him , and the City of Baltimore honored him by placing a bronze likeness , more than eight feet tall , outside the Federal courthouse . <br><blue>19</blue>" To do what he did required a heroic imagination , " Paul Gewirtz , one of Justice Marshall 's former law clerks , wrote in a tribute published after the Justice retired from the Court . <br><blue>20</blue>The article by Mr. Gewirtz , the Potter Stewart Professor of Constitutional Law at Yale Law School , continued : " He grew up in a ruthlessly discriminatory world -- a world in which segregation of the races was pervasive and taken for granted , where lynching was common , where the black man 's inherent inferiority was proclaimed widely and wantonly . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>21 states</m_str> (6_48) 	<br><blue>2(13)</blue>: <m_str>the Court</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>the Court</m_str> (19_35) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (7_18) 	<m_str>Supreme Court</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>the Supreme Court</m_str> (1_29) 	<m_str>the Court</m_str> (9_24) 	<m_str>the Court</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>the High Court</m_str> (3_32) 	<m_str>the Supreme Court 's</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>Supreme Court</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>the Supreme Court</m_str> (4_16) 	<m_str>the Court 's</m_str> (3_4) 	<m_str>the Court</m_str> (14_11) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Baltimore</m_str> (15_18) 	<m_str>Baltimore</m_str> (18_19) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (3_56) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (3_60) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>the University of Maryland</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>the University of Maryland</m_str> (15_28) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>1954</m_str> (6_11) 	<m_str>1954</m_str> (6_4) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>the nation 's</m_str> (17_18) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>an end</m_str> (6_27) 	<m_str>an end</m_str> (7_21) 	<br><blue>9(27)</blue>: <m_str>World Mr. Marshall , who was born and reared in Baltimore</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_26) 	<m_str>Justice Marshall</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_30) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (18_13) 	<m_str>Thurgood Marshall</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (18_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_43) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_12) 	<m_str>Justice Marshall 's</m_str> (19_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_22) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>Justice Marshall</m_str> (8_24) 	<m_str>Mr. Marshall</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Marshall</m_str> (11_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the legal strategy</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>the legal strategy</m_str> (9_10) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>the same place</m_str> (11_36) 	<m_str>the same thing</m_str> (11_25) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
