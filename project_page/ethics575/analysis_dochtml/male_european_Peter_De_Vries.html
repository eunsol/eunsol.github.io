<blue>1</blue>Peter De Vries , a writer who was best known as a comic novelist and as a contributor to The New Yorker , died yesterday at Norwalk ( Conn. ) Hospital . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 83 and lived in Westport , Conn . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was pneumonia , said his daughter , , Jan . <br><blue>4</blue>Renata Adler , a novelist and a staff writer for The New Yorker , said yesterday : " He was one of the very few people who were truly funny . <br><blue>5</blue>In his best work , he made people laugh aloud . " <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. De Vries was a staff contributor to The New Yorker from 1944 to 1987 , and for some time afterward served as a consultant . <br><blue>7</blue>He also wrote two dozen books over the years . <br><blue>8</blue>The critic John Gross -- looking back over Mr. De Vries 's career as a novelist in a review of the picaresque novel " Peckham 's Marbles " ( G.P. Putnam 's Sons , 1986 ) , about a novelist addicted to wordplay -- gave this explanation of his humor in The New York Times in 1986 : " The author still remains in a class by himself among contemporary comic writers ; an unsurpassed connoisseur of non sequiturs and wild misunderstandings . <br><blue>9</blue>He is to be relished as much for the skill with which he deploys a recurring expletive -- ' ah hoo boy ' -- as he is for his set-pieces . " <br><blue>10</blue>' You Know You 're Done ' Jan De Vries said deteriorating health had been a cause of his cutting back his work for The New Yorker , and that after 1986 he had done no writing " except eulogies for friends , and a very occasional letter . " <br><blue>11</blue>" I asked him why he was n't working , " she recalled , " and he simply said , ' When you know you 're done , you 're done . " <br><blue>12</blue>In the preceding years and decades , he showed virtuosity in his writing , which was spiced with pungent images : in his 1984 novel " The Prick of Noon " ( published by Little , Brown ) , he likened a hamburger to " a hockey puck on a bun . " <br><blue>13</blue>Wisecracks were another longtime art form for Mr. De Vries , in his novels and in other realms . <br><blue>14</blue>Most of his published writings for The New Yorker were portions of his comic novels , but he helped regularly with the magazine 's cartoons , suggesting improvements in captions and other changes , and sometimes helping to develop a cartoon idea . <br><blue>15</blue>The magazine 's art editor , Lee Lorenz , called Mr. De Vries " a very serious-minded man , a very serious professional . <br><blue>16</blue>He began his career as a poet , and he had a special ear for language . " <br><blue>17</blue>Transatlantic Career Mr. De Vries had devoted readers on both sides of the Atlantic , and he was particularly esteemed by the British . <br><blue>18</blue>But his readership was somewhat modest in size compared with the audiences of big-time best-seller writers : by the early 80 's , the sales of the hard-cover edition of a characteristic De Vries novel would not exceed 25,000 books . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. De Vries was born in Chicago , the son of Joost De Vries and the former Henrietta Eldersveld . <br><blue>20</blue>He grew up in Chicago and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Calvin College in Grand Rapids , Mich. , in 1931 . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>: <m_str>The magazine 's art editor , Lee Lorenz</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_10) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the magazine 's</m_str> (14_22) 	<m_str>The magazine 's</m_str> (15_1) 	<br><blue>3(17)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_6) 	<m_str>Mr. De Vries</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mr. De Vries 's</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>Jan De Vries</m_str> (10_8) 	<m_str>Mr. De Vries</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>Mr. De Vries</m_str> (15_11) 	<m_str>Transatlantic Career Mr. De Vries</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_17) 	<m_str>De Vries</m_str> (18_33) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_2) 	<m_str>Mr. De Vries</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>4(25)</blue>: <m_str>himself</m_str> (8_68) 	<m_str>G.P.
