<blue>1</blue>James E. Meade , an economist who won a Nobel Prize for his pioneering research into international trade and played an influential role in British politics , died on Dec. 22 at his home in Cambridge , England . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 88 . <br><blue>3</blue>His family , which withheld announcement of the death until today , declined to specify the cause of death . <br><blue>4</blue>Professor Meade , who was heavily influenced by the work of John Maynard Keynes , was best known for his work on trade and the international economy , for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Economic Science in 1977 with Bertil Ohlin of Sweden . <br><blue>5</blue>His research analyzed how government tax , spending and interest rate policies affect trade , and how trade policies affect economic welfare . <br><blue>6</blue>Widely respected among economists for the quantitative rigor and detailed knowledge he brought to his work , he spent much of his life trying to apply the lessons of his sometimes arcane work to practical public policy . <br><blue>7</blue>His politics were left-leaning . <br><blue>8</blue>He served as the chief economist to Britain 's post-war Labor Government from 1945 to 1947 , and was an adviser during the 1980 's to the Social Democrats , a centrist party formed by defectors from Labor . <br><blue>9</blue>During the era of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , Professor Meade argued that governments and central banks had gone too far in their emphasis on taming inflation and that more emphasis was needed on creating jobs and reducing unemployment . <br><blue>10</blue>Among the policies he advocated over the years for Britain was a " labor-capital partnership " in which employees would be paid partly in shares of the company for which they worked , and a system under which pay disputes would be settled on the basis of which outcome would create more jobs . <br><blue>11</blue>In " Full Employment Regained ? <br><blue>12</blue>, " published earlier this year , Professor Meade argued that policies of addressing economic ills through education , training and increased investment " are concerned basically with raising the output per head of those who are in employment rather than about the number of heads that will find suitable employment . " <br><blue>13</blue>In an assessment in The New York Times of Professor Meade at the time he won the Nobel Prize , Paul A. Samuelson , the economics professor who won the Nobel Prize in 1970 , wrote : " The last of the utilitarians who trace from Jeremy Bentham , James Meade would give his cloak to a shivering beggar , not only because he feels it is right and fair to do so , but also for the reason that the beggar will receive more pleasure from it than a well-off professor of political economy . " <br><blue>14</blue>James Edward Meade was born in Dorset , England , on June 23 , 1907 . <br><blue>15</blue>He graduated from Oriel College at Oxford University and then did post-graduate work at Trinity College at Cambridge University . <br><blue>16</blue>It was at Cambridge that he encountered Keynes , who included him in a group of young economists would would debate and test ideas that later formed the core of Keynes 's " General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money . " <br><blue>17</blue>After a stint teaching at Cambridge , he became an economist in 1937 for the League of Nations in Geneva , where he remained until the outbreak of World War II . <br><blue>18</blue>During the war he helped manage economic policy for the British Government , and from 1945 until 1947 was director of the Cabinet 's economic section under the post-war Labor Government . <br><blue>19</blue>He then spent a decade teaching and doing research on trade at the London School of Economics , followed by another decade at Cambridge , where he was a professor of political economy until 1968 . <br><blue>20</blue>His most influential works , collectively known as " The Theory of International Economic Policy , " were published in two volumes in 1951 and 1955 . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>Britain</m_str> (10_10) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>Cambridge</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>Cambridge</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>Cambridge</m_str> (19_24) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>his sometimes arcane work to practical public policy</m_str> (6_30) 	<br><blue>4(33)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_30) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Professor Meade , who was heavily influenced by the work of John Maynard Keynes</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>James Meade</m_str> (13_50) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_54) 	<m_str>Professor Meade</m_str> (12_8) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_20) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_64) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_27) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_31) 	<m_str>Professor Meade</m_str> (9_10) 	<m_str>Professor Meade at the time</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_4) 	<m_str>James Edward Meade</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_18) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_22) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Bertil Ohlin of Sweden</m_str> (4_42) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Nobel Prize</m_str> (4_33) 	<m_str>a Nobel Prize</m_str> (1_9) 	<m_str>the Nobel Prize</m_str> (13_30) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>his pioneering research</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>His research</m_str> (5_1) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>His politics</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>British politics</m_str> (1_25) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (10_31) 	<m_str>employees</m_str> (10_19) 	<br><blue>10(3)</blue>: <m_str>It</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Cambridge University</m_str> (15_18) 	<m_str>Oxford University</m_str> (15_7) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>his work on trade</m_str> (4_20) 	<m_str>the work of John Maynard Keynes</m_str> (4_9) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (9_23) 	<m_str>governments and central banks</m_str> (9_14) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
