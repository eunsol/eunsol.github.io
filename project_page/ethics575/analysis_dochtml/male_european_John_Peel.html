<blue>1</blue>John Peel , a BBC radio disc jockey who was a champion of innovative and independent music for nearly four decades , died on Monday night in Cuzco , Peru . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 65 and was a longtime resident of Great Finborough , England . <br><blue>3</blue>The BBC reported that he had a heart attack while on vacation with his wife , Sheila . <br><blue>4</blue>A broadcasting legend in Britain and perhaps the only British D.J. known by name to American rock fans , Mr. Peel had been on the BBC 's Radio 1 since its inception in 1967 and had a reputation for playing cutting-edge music from around the world . <br><blue>5</blue>Though most American listeners could not hear his show until the advent of the Internet , fans were well familiar with the phenomenon of '' Peel Sessions . '' <br><blue>6</blue>From the first days of his program , Mr. Peel invited groups into the studio for live performances that were , by practical necessity , scrappy and unembellished . <br><blue>7</blue>The bands , chosen by Mr. Peel and his staff , were often unfamiliar to most listeners ; many were on Mr. Peel 's show even before they had recording contracts . <br><blue>8</blue>The sessions , which were sometimes live and sometimes taped in the weeks before a broadcast , were often circulated in bootleg recordings , and many were released commercially . <br><blue>9</blue>Over the years hundreds of bands recorded on Mr. Peel 's show , from Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd to the Damned , Napalm Death , the Smiths , the Birthday Party , Nirvana , Smashing Pumpkins and the Pixies . <br><blue>10</blue>More recently the guests included Clinic , Elastica , Mouse on Mars , Gorky 's Zygotic Mynci , the Make-Up , Cat Power and Neko Case . <br><blue>11</blue>He was an unabashed advocate for hungry new bands . <br><blue>12</blue>When the Undertones , a British punk group , released their song '' Teenage Kicks '' in 1978 , it did not reach the pop charts , but Mr. Peel played it relentlessly on his show and has long raved about the band as one of his favorites ; after his death was announced yesterday , Radio 1 played '' Teenage Kicks '' in tribute . <br><blue>13</blue>Born John Ravenscroft in Heswall , near Liverpool , Mr. Peel began his radio career in the United States . <br><blue>14</blue>He worked for a number of American stations in the early 60 's , including WRR in Dallas , and when he returned to England in 1967 went to work for Radio London , a pirate station that broadcast from a ship outside British territorial waters . <br><blue>15</blue>Later that year he was hired as one of the first D.J. 's on the BBC 's new all-pop station , Radio 1 . <br><blue>16</blue>His live studio performances began as a way to comply with broadcasting rules . <br><blue>17</blue>A legal requirement of radio stations at the time , limited the amount of time that could be devoted to playing records ; the Radio 1 crew met the requirement by bringing in new groups eager for radio play . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Peel was on Radio 1 three times a week , and since 1998 also had a program on Radio 4 called '' Home Truths , '' about family life . <br><blue>19</blue>He was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 1998 . <br><blue>20</blue>Besides his wife , his survivors include four children . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>the Undertones , a British punk group</m_str> (12_2) 	<br><blue>2(5)</blue>: <m_str>BBC</m_str> (1_5) 	<m_str>The BBC</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (4_31) 	<m_str>the BBC 's</m_str> (4_25) 	<m_str>the BBC 's</m_str> (15_15) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (12_20) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (12_32) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>1998</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>1998</m_str> (19_11) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (5_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_6) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>his wife , Sheila</m_str> (3_14) 	<m_str>his wife</m_str> (20_2) 	<br><blue>7(23)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Peel</m_str> (4_20) 	<m_str>Mr. Peel</m_str> (6_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Peel 's</m_str> (7_22) 	<m_str>Mr. Peel</m_str> (7_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Peel 's</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Peel</m_str> (12_29) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_35) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_47) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_51) 	<m_str>Mr. Peel</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_22) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Peel</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_5) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>his show</m_str> (5_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Peel 's show</m_str> (9_9) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Gorky 's</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>A legal requirement of radio stations at the time</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>the requirement</m_str> (17_29) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
