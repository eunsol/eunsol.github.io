<blue>1</blue>Dieter Roth , a prolific , notoriously irascible , reclusive and eccentric German-born artist-provocateur who built a formidable reputation in Europe but remained something of a mystery in America , in part because he permitted his work to be exhibited here even more rarely than there , died on Saturday in Basel , Switzerland , where he had a home . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 68 . <br><blue>3</blue>He had heart problems , Carol Eckman , his New York dealer , said . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Roth was a sculptor , performer , book designer , poet , graphic artist , publisher and musician , sort of . <br><blue>5</blue>Born Karl-Dietrich Roth in Germany in 1930 , the son of a sugar beet farmer , he and a brother were sent for safekeeping in 1943 to Switzerland , a country that has always seemed to attract and cultivate people of nomadic and unusual temperament like him . <br><blue>6</blue>He settled at a hostel for refugees in Zurich , where he stayed for four years and studied Greek , Latin and French at the local secondary school . <br><blue>7</blue>He began to exhibit in 1958 . <br><blue>8</blue>With fellow artists Hermann Nitsch and Gunter Brus , he did improvisatory concerts of cacophonous music . <br><blue>9</blue>He staged a concert of howling dogs . <br><blue>10</blue>Once he collaborated with Richard Hamilton , the English artist , on an exhibition for dogs ( the pictures , of sausages and other images he thought would be of special interest to them , were hung at dog-eye level ) . <br><blue>11</blue>In 1975 , he founded the Zeitschrift fur Alles , a journal that published anything submitted to it . <br><blue>12</blue>In Los Angeles , he conceived an installation of 40 suitcases filled with different types of cheese . <br><blue>13</blue>He often made sculptures out of fugitive materials like baked dough , chocolate , mayonnaise and rabbit droppings ( fortunately , not all at the same time ) . <br><blue>14</blue>Their natural deterioration , which he equated with his own death , became an integral part of his art . <br><blue>15</blue>All of this situated Mr. Roth within a post-war European scene that included Joseph Beuys , Yves Klein , Lucio Fontana and others who experimented with unorthodox techniques and who generally tried to blur the boundaries between performance and sculpture , theater and visual art , high culture and low . <br><blue>16</blue>He was perhaps best known as a maker of multifarious artist-books , hundreds of them . <br><blue>17</blue>( One was as small as the eraser on a pencil ; another , '' Literaturwurst , '' consisted of various periodicals chopped up , mixed with lard and spices and stuffed into a sausage casing . ) <br><blue>18</blue>He was famously reclusive and difficult , notwithstanding his friendships with artists . <br><blue>19</blue>It was through , Daniel Spoerri , for instance , that he met various members of the irreverent movement called Fluxus . <br><blue>20</blue>Mr. Roth 's link to Fluxus involved , among other things , his interest in music and sound , in ephemeral materials and in an anarchic kind of pranksterish humor . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>his work</m_str> (1_36) 	<br><blue>2(27)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (5_47) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>Richard Hamilton</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_34) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_26) 	<m_str>Mr. Roth</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_57) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Roth 's</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Karl-Dietrich Roth</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>the son of a sugar beet farmer , he and a brother</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (3_10) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Roth within a post-war European scene that included Joseph Beuys , Yves Klein , Lucio Fontana and others who experimented with unorthodox techniques and who generally tried to blur the boundaries between performance and sculpture , theater and visual art , high culture and low</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (16_15) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Basel</m_str> (1_52) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Fluxus</m_str> (19_21) 	<m_str>Fluxus</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>his own death</m_str> (14_9) 	<br><blue>8(5)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Lucio Fontana</m_str> (15_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_12) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
