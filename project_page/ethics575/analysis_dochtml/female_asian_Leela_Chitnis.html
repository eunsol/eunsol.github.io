<blue>1</blue>Leela Chitnis , an actress whose half-century-long 40-film career in India progressed from romantic roles to the motherly ones for which she is best remembered , died on Monday at a hospital in Danbury , Conn . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 93 . <br><blue>3</blue>She had been living in Connecticut for many years to be near her family . <br><blue>4</blue>Ms. Chitnis began her acting career onstage at a time women seldom worked as actors . <br><blue>5</blue>Her son Manavedra Chitnis said that women who did act were regarded as prostitutes , and so Ms. Chitnis was shunned by Brahmans , the priestly caste of which she was a member . <br><blue>6</blue>She did not care , her son said , nor was she abashed by these prejudices when she moved on , in the 1930 's , to India 's large and lively movie industry in Bombay , now known as Bollywood . <br><blue>7</blue>She began playing romantic leads and became one of the best-known heroines in the country . <br><blue>8</blue>From 1948 into the 1980 's , she worked as a character actor , becoming famous in the 1950 's and 60 's for her portrayals of mothers . <br><blue>9</blue>In these roles , she developed an image of sober probity , underlined by gold-rimmed glasses and white saris . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Whenever I think of her , I still shake with awe , '' said Jyotirmoy Datta , the senior arts editor for News-India Times , an English-language weekly published in New York . '' <br><blue>11</blue>She seemed to be always right and prepared to follow the straight path of virtue . '' <br><blue>12</blue>In a review of her work in 1997 in India-West magazine , published in Emeryville , Calif. , R. M. Vijayakar called Ms. Chitnis the Duchess of Depression , not least because of her characteristic cough . '' <br><blue>13</blue>If she appeared on screen it was to cough consumptively , gobble spoonfuls of syrup from bottles perched so precariously on bedside tables that they overturned and crashed to the floor when there was no money to buy another , '' he wrote . <br><blue>14</blue>Ms. Chitnis was born on Sept. 9 , 1909 , in a small town near Bombay . <br><blue>15</blue>Her father was an English professor who adhered to Brahmo Samaj , a religious movement that rejected caste . <br><blue>16</blue>She married a much older man at 15 or 16 , and quickly had four children . <br><blue>17</blue>The couple supported India 's struggle for independence from Britain and once risked arrest by harboring Manabendra Nath Roy , a Marxist freedom fighter . <br><blue>18</blue>After they divorced , she worked as a schoolteacher and began acting onstage in melodramas typical of the time . <br><blue>19</blue>She appeared in several movies , and went through a Bombay university in order to be hired by a major studio , Bombay Talkies ; it hired only college graduates . <br><blue>20</blue>She soon made three hit films -- '' Kangan , '' '' Bandhan '' and '' Jhoola '' -- with Ashok Kumar , who became one of India 's top male stars . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Bombay Talkies</m_str> (19_23) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (19_26) 	<br><blue>2(5)</blue>: <m_str>the country</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>Bombay</m_str> (6_36) 	<m_str>the 1980 's</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>Bombay</m_str> (14_16) 	<m_str>Bombay</m_str> (19_11) 	<br><blue>3(4)</blue>: <m_str>India 's</m_str> (20_28) 	<m_str>India 's</m_str> (6_28) 	<m_str>India 's</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>India</m_str> (1_11) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (10_2) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>romantic roles</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>these roles</m_str> (9_2) 	<br><blue>6(30)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Chitnis</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Her son Manavedra Chitnis</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_25) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Chitnis the Duchess of Depression , not least</m_str> (12_23) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (1_22) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Chitnis</m_str> (5_18) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_34) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>Ms. Chitnis</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_18) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (11_1) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
