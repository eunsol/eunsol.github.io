<blue>1</blue>Tunku Abdul Rahman , the gregarious noble who led in the founding of Malaysia and who was for 13 years its first Prime Minister after it became independent from Britain in 1957 , died yesterday in General Hospital in Kuala Lumpur . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 87 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>The Tunku , or prince in Malay , as he was called , had heart and kidney problems , the Government said . <br><blue>4</blue>He went into a coma on Wednesday . <br><blue>5</blue>As he wished , the Tunku will be buried in accordance with Muslim rites at the Langgar Royal Mausoleum in his birthplace of Alor Star , a Malaysian state . <br><blue>6</blue>The chief secretary to the Government , Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid , said the Tunku would be given a full state funeral . <br><blue>7</blue>A national holiday was declared yesterday . <br><blue>8</blue>The Tunku was the seventh son of Prince Abdul Rahman Ibni , a sultan who ruled for 61 years in Kedah , a northern principality . <br><blue>9</blue>His mother was Makche Menjelara , who was half Burmese and half Siamese . <br><blue>10</blue>She was a daughter of Luang Mira , a chieftan of the Siamese Shan states . <br><blue>11</blue>Law Student in England The Tunku 's ancestors ruled a jungle dynasty that continued unbroken through 9 Hindu rajahs and 20 Muslim sultans . <br><blue>12</blue>But in his student days , there were questions about his ability and predisposition to lead . <br><blue>13</blue>He was unspectacular as a law student in England . <br><blue>14</blue>He did not gain admittance to the bar there until he was 47 years old . <br><blue>15</blue>When he made it , he broke the solemnity of the Inner Temple London Law School when he said , " I must be the only student to be admitted to the bar on his silver jubilee . " <br><blue>16</blue>Until he returned to his homeland to begin a life of public service , he was known for his interest in poker , golf , soccer , tennis and a red sports car , not as the leader who would have the patience and skill to try to lead the ethnic Malays , most of them Muslim , and the Chinese , most of them Confucian-Buddhist , in a Government that would be at best unwieldy and at worst fraught with violence . <br><blue>17</blue>Yet , he was able to walk the line between the two religions and won the trust of both . <br><blue>18</blue>He became a success symbol for Chinese-Malay political cooperation and was known for his self-effacing wit and ability to move audiences with simply spoken common sense . <br><blue>19</blue>In his tenure he was consistently pro-Western and anti-Communist . <br><blue>20</blue>Out of Retirement The intensity of his desire to see Malaysia succeed was such that in 1969 , after violence had erupted between the Malays and Chinese , leaving hundreds dead , he wept uncontrollably on national radio . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Kedah</m_str> (8_21) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Malay</m_str> (3_7) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (16_65) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (16_56) 	<br><blue>4(33)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>the Tunku</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_21) 	<m_str>The chief secretary to the Government , Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>the Tunku</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>The Tunku</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>England The Tunku 's</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>England</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_18) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (15_22) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_35) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_33) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Malaysia</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>Malaysia</m_str> (20_11) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>His mother</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (1_21) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (1_26) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Siamese Shan states</m_str> (10_12) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
