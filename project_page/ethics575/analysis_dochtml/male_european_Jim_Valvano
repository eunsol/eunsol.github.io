<blue>1</blue>Jim Valvano , the fast-talking , wisecracking New York-bred basketball coach who led North Carolina State to its Cinderella 1983 national championship , died yesterday at Duke University Medical Center after a yearlong battle with cancer . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 47 . <br><blue>3</blue>Valvano , who had been a basketball commentator since he left North Carolina State amid controversy in 1990 , had been admitted to the hospital , in Durham , N.C. , at the end of March . <br><blue>4</blue>During the last months of his life , Valvano , whose family was at his side at the end , had grown close to the Duke basketball coach , Mike Krzyzewski , who issued a statement yesterday . <br><blue>5</blue>" Jim was a dreamer , motivator and a fighter , " he said . <br><blue>6</blue>" He did all those things to the last day . " <br><blue>7</blue>An Unexpected Presence It was in the 1950 's that Frank McGuire established the pipeline that took crack New York City players to the Carolinas . <br><blue>8</blue>But for all their resulting familiarity with New York coaches and New York ways , the people and fans of North Carolina were simply not prepared for what hit them -- and their ears -- when Valvano took over as head coach at North Carolina State in 1980 . <br><blue>9</blue>Valvano , a Queens native who had coached Iona to a 94-47 record over the previous five seasons , was seen and heard as the quintessential Noo Yawker . <br><blue>10</blue>Well before the Wolfpack won the 1983 national championship in his third season , Valvano had made himself into the state 's most visible , and audible , character , appearing almost incessantly on a statewide radio hookup , accepting speaking engagements in every Carolina town and cheerfully promoting a soft drink , a health club , a fast-food chain and a bank . <br><blue>11</blue>Valvano 's various activities not so much supplemented as dwarfed his initial annual salary of $ 50,000 , bringing in an estimated $ 500,000 to $ 1 million a year . <br><blue>12</blue>" I set out very calculatedly to become known , " he said , suggesting that fame would help his recruiting efforts . <br><blue>13</blue>" The only thing I maybe miscalculated was how easy it would be . " <br><blue>14</blue>Whatever misgivings his ubiquitous activities may have engenderded were generally swept away by his impish charm and his self-deprecating humor . <br><blue>15</blue>Flyfishing , a North Carolina passion , was alien to him , he would explain . <br><blue>16</blue>" It 's tough casting into a fire hydrant . " <br><blue>17</blue>A Stunning Season North Carolinians were mollified even further by what happened at the end of the 1983 season . <br><blue>18</blue>The Wolfpack finished the regular season in a tie for third place in the Atlantic Coast Conference with an 8-6 record , 17-10 over all . <br><blue>19</blue>They did not lose again , winning a bid to the N.C.A.A. tournament by capturing the conference tournament , and upsetting higher-ranked teams to reach the final . <br><blue>20</blue>Their opponent was top-ranked Houston , which had won 26 straight games led by Clyde Drexler and the 7-foot Hakeem Olajuwon , currently stars in the National Basketball Association . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (8_30) 	<m_str>the people</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (8_33) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (8_4) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>the 7-foot Hakeem Olajuwon</m_str> (20_18) 	<br><blue>3(7)</blue>: <m_str>North Carolina State</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>North Carolina State</m_str> (3_12) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (1_18) 	<m_str>North Carolina</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>North Carolina State in 1980</m_str> (8_44) 	<m_str>North Carolina</m_str> (8_21) 	<m_str>the state 's</m_str> (10_20) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Duke</m_str> (4_26) 	<m_str>Duke University Medical Center</m_str> (1_27) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the end of March</m_str> (3_33) 	<m_str>the end</m_str> (4_18) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>They</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Their</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>The Wolfpack</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>the Wolfpack</m_str> (10_3) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the 1983 season</m_str> (17_17) 	<m_str>the regular season</m_str> (18_4) 	<br><blue>9(8)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_15) 	<m_str>Jim</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>Valvano , whose family was at his side at the end</m_str> (4_9) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>Iona</m_str> (9_9) 	<br><blue>11(12)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (12_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_3) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_11) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (10_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_13) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (12_2) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>The only thing I maybe miscalculated</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (13_11) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>An Unexpected Presence It was in the 1950 's that Frank McGuire</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (7_4) 	<br><blue>14(4)</blue>: <m_str>Valvano , a Queens native who had coached Iona to a 94-47 record over the previous five seasons</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Valvano</m_str> (8_37) 	<m_str>Valvano</m_str> (10_15) 	<m_str>Valvano 's</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>15(3)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>New York City</m_str> (7_19) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
