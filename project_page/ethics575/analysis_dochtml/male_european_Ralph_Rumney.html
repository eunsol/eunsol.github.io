<blue>1</blue>Ralph Rumney , an English-born artist who romanced just about every eccentric left-wing intellectual movement he encountered over a half-century -- and helped start a few -- died on March 6 at his home in Manosque in the Provence region of France . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 67 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , the news agency Agence France-Presse reported . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Rumney founded no philosophical schools , nor did the art he produced so voluminously bear any important influence . <br><blue>5</blue>But he displayed an uncanny knack for finding himself where intellectual cauldrons were bubbling , and tossing in some memorably zestful spice . <br><blue>6</blue>In 1957 , Mr. Rumney was a founding member of the Situationist International , a movement that mixed Surrealism , Marxism and sometimes spectacular hedonism and that has been described as the spiritual precursor to the Paris riots of 1968 , the Sex Pistols and the sensationalist art of people like Damien Hirst . <br><blue>7</blue>The tiny movement has remained a subject of fascination in France , where books on it appear regularly . <br><blue>8</blue>Within months of the group 's formation , at a weeklong meeting in a bar in Italy , Mr. Rumney was the first member to be expelled by the group 's leader , Guy Debord , who had a penchant for excommunication . <br><blue>9</blue>Forty-five of the 70 members were eventually expelled . <br><blue>10</blue>But Mr. Rumney kept the faith and as late as 2000 called together Situationists and their fellow travelers from five countries for a month of drinking and debating in Manosque . '' <br><blue>11</blue>Ralph is a hero , '' said Michel Guet , leader of the Banalistes , a group of avant-garde artists , at the conclave . '' <br><blue>12</blue>He has refused to concede that the dreams of the old avant-gardes are finished . <br><blue>13</blue>That is why artists will build monuments to him in the 21st century . '' <br><blue>14</blue>The central belief of the Situationists , aside from the frequent denial that they had any beliefs at all , was that people were no longer participants in their own lives , but spectators . <br><blue>15</blue>Reality , they said , was being replaced by images in what they called the '' spectacular society . '' <br><blue>16</blue>The situationists rejected art as an ornament of privilege and a commodity for consumption . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Rumney agreed with his cohorts , and saw his finished art as a necessarily muddled reflection of his initial idea . <br><blue>18</blue>But that somehow did not stop him from producing a vast outpouring of art over the years , from informal abstracts to large canvases using gold and silver leaf to plaster sculptures to Polaroid pictures and videos . <br><blue>19</blue>One of his paintings hangs in the Tate Gallery in London , and he sold his work at shows , but he refused to take art completely seriously . <br><blue>20</blue>He also insisted that no art could be truly original .
