<blue>1</blue>Marian E. Koshland , an immunologist and professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California at Berkeley who studied the ways antibodies fight off disease , died on Tuesday at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 76 and lived in Lafayette , Calif . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was lung cancer , the university said . <br><blue>4</blue>Dr. Koshland , a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the president of the American Association of Immunologists in 1982 and 1983 , discovered that antibodies differ in their amino acid composition , a factor that makes them extremely efficient at fending off disease . <br><blue>5</blue>She made the discovery by studying a molecule of phosphate and a molecule of arsenate . <br><blue>6</blue>The two substances are somewhat similar chemically , but she found that they produced distinct and noticeably different antibodies when exposed to an antigen . <br><blue>7</blue>She also discovered a molecular chain that allows antibodies to be exported from a cell and to circulate in the bloodstream . <br><blue>8</blue>In 1991 she and her colleagues at Berkeley described the characteristics of a pathway that apparently serves as an intracellular superhighway , bypassing normal intracellular communication channels and making possible the proliferation of B-cells , which are essential in fighting off infection . <br><blue>9</blue>Dr. Koshland , who was born in New Haven on Oct. 25 , 1921 , received a bachelor 's degree from Vassar College in 1942 , a master 's degree from Vassar the next year and a doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1949 . <br><blue>10</blue>During World War II , she worked on a research team that produced a vaccine for cholera , and in 1945 and 1946 she was a research assistant on the Manhattan Project , which developed the atomic bomb . <br><blue>11</blue>After two years as a fellow in the department of bacteriology at Harvard University , she joined the staff of the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island , first as an associate bacteriologist in the biology department and , from 1963 to 1965 , as a bacteriologist . <br><blue>12</blue>She moved to Berkeley in 1965 as an associate research immunologist in the virus laboratory . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1966 , she became a lecturer in the department of molecularly biology . <br><blue>14</blue>She was named a professor in the department of microbiology and immunology in 1970 , and headed the department from 1982 to 1989 . <br><blue>15</blue>Dr. Koshland , who was also the head of the graduate affairs division in the department , was a member of the National Science Board from 1976 to 1982 and of the National Academy of Arts and Sciences . <br><blue>16</blue>She had continued to do research in her laboratory until recently . <br><blue>17</blue>She is survived by her husband , Daniel E. Koshland Jr. , a biochemist at Berkeley and a former editor of the journal Science ; five children , Ellen Koshland McCaughey of Melbourne , Australia ; Phyllis Koshland of Paris ; James , of Palo Alto , Calif. ; Gail Koshland Wachtel of Tucson , Ariz. , and Douglas , of Baltimore , and nine grandchildren . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>The two substances</m_str> (6_1) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the National Academy of Arts and Sciences</m_str> (15_32) 	<m_str>the National Academy of Sciences</m_str> (4_7) 	<br><blue>3(6)</blue>: <m_str>the biology department</m_str> (11_35) 	<m_str>the department</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>the department of bacteriology at Harvard University</m_str> (11_8) 	<m_str>the department of microbiology and immunology</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>the department of molecularly biology</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>the department</m_str> (15_15) 	<br><blue>4(16)</blue>: <m_str>she</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_24) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (8_3) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_5) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_8) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>antibodies</m_str> (4_28) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (4_31) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (4_40) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Brookhaven National Laboratory</m_str> (11_21) 	<m_str>her laboratory</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>the virus laboratory</m_str> (12_13) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the University of California at Berkeley</m_str> (1_15) 	<m_str>the university</m_str> (3_7) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>Berkeley</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>Berkeley</m_str> (17_16) 	<m_str>Berkeley</m_str> (1_39) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
