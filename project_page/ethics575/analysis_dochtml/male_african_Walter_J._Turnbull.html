<blue>1</blue>Walter J. Turnbull , who founded the Boys Choir of Harlem , died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 62 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , said his brother Horace , the choir 's former executive vice president . <br><blue>4</blue>From modest beginnings in the basement of a church on 123rd Street , the choir went on to sing for presidents and popes . <br><blue>5</blue>It has been celebrated around the world as much for its eclectic musical standards -- a typical program ranged from Handel to spirituals , jazz and pop -- as for being a symbol of bootstrap success in the ghetto , though the group has recently fallen on hard times after financial and managerial scandals . <br><blue>6</blue>Born to a poor family in rural Greenville , Miss. , Dr. Turnbull won a music scholarship to Tougaloo College in Mississippi and , after graduation , moved to New York with dreams of being an operatic tenor . <br><blue>7</blue>Cleaning toilets and driving cabs for a living , he also sang as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra . <br><blue>8</blue>He was working toward a doctorate at the Manhattan School of Music when he started the choir as an after-school music program in the basement of the Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1968 . <br><blue>9</blue>Incorporated as the Boys Choir of Harlem in 1975 , the group , which usually included about 150 boys , eventually spawned a 600-student school , the Choir Academy of Harlem , which offered a full academic program in grades 4 through 12 . <br><blue>10</blue>Reflecting Dr. Turnbull 's belief that musical training focuses the mind and helps any child succeed in life , the school had a strict dress code , and the choirboys always appeared clean-cut and disciplined . <br><blue>11</blue>Dr. Turnbull also founded the Girls Choir of Harlem in 1988 . <br><blue>12</blue>Dr. Turnbull received the National Medal of Arts from President Clinton in 1997 and many other honors , including being named to the New York Black 100 by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture . <br><blue>13</blue>Despite its renown , the choir and the school had chronic financial shortages , racking up as much as $ 5 million in debts in recent years . <br><blue>14</blue>In 2001 , a complaint from a 14-year-old academy student that he had been sexually abused by the school 's chief counselor set in motion a chain of events that dismantled the school and weakened the choir . <br><blue>15</blue>In 2004 , after a city investigation criticized Dr. Turnbull for not reporting the allegations of abuse , he was replaced as chief executive of the choir , though he was allowed to remain artistic director , and his brother was forced to leave . <br><blue>16</blue>Two years later , citing the choir 's financial and management problems , the city evicted the choir and school from its building on Madison Avenue and 127th Street , where it had received free space since 1993 . <br><blue>17</blue>The school is now closed , and the choir has only about 50 members and a minimal volunteer staff . <br><blue>18</blue>Besides his brother Horace , of Nanuet , N.Y. , Dr. Turnbull is survived by another brother , Sammy J. Turnbull , also of Nanuet , and a sister , Mary Webster of Atlanta . <br><blue>19</blue>Correction : April 3 , 2007 , Tuesday An obituary last Tuesday about Walter J. Turnbull , the founder of the Boys Choir of Harlem , referred incorrectly to the status of the Choir Academy of Harlem , a public school that was created in partnership with the choir . <br><blue>20</blue>Although the school is no longer affiliated with the choir , it does remain open ; it did not close last year when the choir was evicted from the building . <br><hr><br><blue>1(9)</blue>: <m_str>a 600-student school , the Choir Academy of Harlem , which offered a full academic program in grades 4 through 12</m_str> (9_23) 	<m_str>the school</m_str> (10_20) 	<m_str>the school</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>the school 's</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>the school</m_str> (14_32) 	<m_str>The school</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (20_12) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (20_17) 	<m_str>the school</m_str> (20_2) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>its building</m_str> (16_22) 	<m_str>the building</m_str> (20_29) 	<br><blue>3(17)</blue>: <m_str>the Boys Choir of Harlem</m_str> (1_7) 	<m_str>the choir 's</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>the choir</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>the group</m_str> (5_42) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>the choir</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>the group</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>the Boys Choir of Harlem</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>the choir</m_str> (14_36) 	<m_str>the choir</m_str> (15_26) 	<m_str>the choir</m_str> (16_17) 	<m_str>the choir 's</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>the choir</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>the choir</m_str> (19_48) 	<m_str>the choir</m_str> (20_24) 	<m_str>the choir</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (16_32) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (16_22) 	<m_str>the city</m_str> (16_14) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>April 3 , 2007 , Tuesday</m_str> (19_3) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>Harlem</m_str> (19_25) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Nanuet</m_str> (18_7) 	<m_str>Nanuet</m_str> (18_25) 	<br><blue>8(13)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>Dr. Turnbull</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>Dr. Turnbull 's</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>Dr. Turnbull</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Turnbull</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Turnbull</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>Sammy J.
