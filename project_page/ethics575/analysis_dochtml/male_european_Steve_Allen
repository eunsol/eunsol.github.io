<blue>1</blue>Steve Allen , the versatile entertainer who created the '' Tonight '' show for NBC in 1953 and was widely regarded as a founding father of the late-night talk show , died on Monday at the home of his son Bill in Los Angeles . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 78 and lived in Los Angeles . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was apparently a heart attack , his family said . <br><blue>4</blue>In more than 50 years in show business , Mr. Allen demonstrated his talents in many areas . <br><blue>5</blue>An accomplished pianist who never learned to read music , he composed more than 5,000 songs , some of them hits . <br><blue>6</blue>Among them were '' This Could Be the Start of Something Big , '' '' Impossible '' and '' Gravy Waltz . '' <br><blue>7</blue>He wrote the lyrics for some movie music , including ballads heard in '' Picnic , '' '' Houseboat '' and '' On the Beach . '' <br><blue>8</blue>He also wrote more than 50 books , all of them dictated into a small tape recorder that he always carried . <br><blue>9</blue>They ranged from poetry and novels to social criticism , music , foreign affairs and , of course , humor . <br><blue>10</blue>A new book , '' Steve Allen 's Private Joke File , '' is to be published in December . <br><blue>11</blue>Mr. Allen was keenly interested in social justice and wrote pamphlets on a variety of issues , including the problems facing migrant workers , as well as capital punishment and nuclear proliferation . <br><blue>12</blue>( He was opposed to both . ) <br><blue>13</blue>He once considered running for Congress from California , calling his politics '' middle-of-the-road radicalism , '' which was his way of describing mid-century liberalism . <br><blue>14</blue>He acted in several movies , among them '' The Benny Goodman Story '' ( 1955 ) , in which he played the title role , and was a master of ceremonies or a guest on many television programs , including several versions of '' The Steve Allen Show '' as well as '' I 've Got a Secret '' and '' What 's My Line ? '' <br><blue>15</blue>But he was probably best known for the humor that seemed to tumble effortlessly from his lips in television appearances , accompanied by a high-pitched giggle . <br><blue>16</blue>Mr. Allen believed that everyone had a '' silly center '' and that no one should try to suppress it . <br><blue>17</blue>So when he was told that he had colon cancer in 1986 , he said he would list his condition as critical : '' critical of nurses , critical of doctors , critical of the food , critical of the prices . '' <br><blue>18</blue>When the hospital listed his condition as stable , Mr. Allen said , '' You know what the condition of the average stable is . '' <br><blue>19</blue>In his heyday on the '' Tonight '' show , from 1954 to 1956 , Mr. Allen once delighted his fans by going out on the street dressed as a New York City policeman , hailing a taxi , hurling a huge salami into the back seat and ordering the driver to '' take this to Grand Central Station . '' <br><blue>20</blue>He read an assortment of things to the studio audience , finding much humor in the letters to the editor of The Daily News . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (14_55) 	<m_str>My</m_str> (14_65) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>his condition</m_str> (17_19) 	<m_str>his condition</m_str> (18_5) 	<br><blue>3(31)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_21) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Allen</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_19) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>Steve Allen 's Private</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_39) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Allen</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Allen</m_str> (18_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Allen</m_str> (4_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_13) 	<m_str>Mr. Allen</m_str> (19_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_20) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_11) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_20) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>4(4)</blue>: <m_str>all of them</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>more than 5,000 songs</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (5_20) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>more than 50 books</m_str> (8_4) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (2_7) 	<m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (1_43) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>the title role</m_str> (14_23) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
