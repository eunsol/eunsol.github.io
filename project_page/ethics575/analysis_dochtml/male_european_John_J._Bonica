<blue>1</blue>Dr. John J. Bonica , an anesthesiologist and leader in the effort to understand pain and cope with it , died on Monday at St. Mary 's Hospital in Rochester , Minn. , where he was being treated at the Mayo Clinic . <br><blue>2</blue>A resident of Mercer Island , Wash. , he was 77 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage , said the University of Washington School of Medicine , where the doctor was a professor and chairman emeritus of the Department of Anesthesiology . <br><blue>4</blue>Born in Italy , Dr. Bonica came to this country in 1927 and worked his way through school , graduating from medical school in 1942 . <br><blue>5</blue>He committed himself to the alleviation of pain while tending to the wounded of World War II . <br><blue>6</blue>When his own wife almost died in childbirth , he took up a pioneering effort against the pain of childbirth , and was instrumental in developing epidural anesthesia . <br><blue>7</blue>Dr. Bonica was the founder and former director of the Multidisciplinary Pain Center at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle . <br><blue>8</blue>He wrote and edited scores of books and hundreds of articles . <br><blue>9</blue>His two-volume " The Management of Pain , " published in 1953 , was completely rewritten and republished in 1990 . <br><blue>10</blue>It remains in use by students and doctors around the world in six translations . <br><blue>11</blue>Only weeks before his death , Dr. Bonica finished an update of his equally comprehensive " Principles and Practice of Obstetric and Analgesic Anesthesia , " first published in 1967 . <br><blue>12</blue>Amateur Wrestling Champion He was born on the island of Filicudi , off Messina , and was brought to New York City at age 10 . <br><blue>13</blue>He was 14 when his father died , and he supported the family by shining shoes , hawking newspapers , and selling fruits and vegetables . <br><blue>14</blue>In high school he became an amateur wrestling champion . <br><blue>15</blue>He turned professional to finance his studies at Long Island University and Marquette University School of Medicine , wrestling at carnivals in the summer and winning several more titles . <br><blue>16</blue>After an internship and residency at St. Vincent 's Hospital in New York , he was inducted into the Army and sent to Fort Lewis , Wash. , where he became chief of anesthesiology at Madigan Army Hospital at age 27 . <br><blue>17</blue>For three years , he advanced the techniques of regional blocks as a novel form of anesthesia . <br><blue>18</blue>His pain relief helped thousands of wounded combat soldiers in his care . <br><blue>19</blue>His wife , Emma Louise Baldetti Bonica , almost fell victim to complications of ether anesthesia while giving birth to their first child . <br><blue>20</blue>This prompted him to devise a now routinely administered continuous epidural analgesia that affects the nerves leading to the chest and lower half of the body , numbing the woman 's pain without her losing consciousness . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (1_35) 	<m_str>the doctor</m_str> (3_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (2_9) 	<br><blue>2(26)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Bonica</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Bonica</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_15) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (20_3) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (5_3) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_30) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Bonica</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_4) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>His wife , Emma Louise Baldetti Bonica</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his own wife</m_str> (6_2) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>pain</m_str> (1_15) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (1_19) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Army</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>Madigan Army Hospital at age 27</m_str> (16_36) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Wash.</m_str> (2_7) 	<m_str>Wash.</m_str> (16_27) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
