<blue>1</blue>George Mackay Brown , a poet , novelist and short story writer whose work evoked the rugged life and the history and culture of the remote Orkney Islands in Scotland , died on Saturday in a hospital in Kirkwall in the Orkneys . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 74 . <br><blue>3</blue>Writing in the British magazine The Listener , Seamus Heaney said that Mr. Brown 's imagination " is stirred by legends of the Viking warrior and Christian saint , " and added , " It consecrates the visible survivals of history , and ruins of time , into altars that are decked with the writings themselves . " <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Heaney said he had never seen Mr. Brown 's poetry sufficiently praised . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Brown was born and remained rooted in the Orkneys , and his art was filled with the rich lore and humanity of the people he knew so well . <br><blue>6</blue>He also explored Scottish myths and mysticism as well as rituals of the Roman Catholic faith . <br><blue>7</blue>At the same time , he expressed a social consciousness , as in his first novel , " Greenvoe , " which described the death of a 1,000-year-old village at the hands of a military-industrial establishment . <br><blue>8</blue>Reviewing the author 's collection " A Time to Keep and Other Stories " in The New York Times Book Review in 1987 , Sheila Gordon wrote that in his " marvelous stories , " the author " holds us in the same way the earliest storyteller held the group around the fire in an ancient cave . " <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Brown spoke with modesty about his own writing . <br><blue>10</blue>He said he believed in " dedicated work rather than in ' inspiration , ' " and added that writing was " a craft like carpentry , plumbing or baking ; one does the best one can . " <br><blue>11</blue>With his thick thatch of hair and his strong jaw , and wearing the clothes of a workingman , he looked very much like the farmers and fishermen who populated his poems and stories . <br><blue>12</blue>He was born in the fishing town of Stromness . <br><blue>13</blue>Leaving school at an early age , he worked as a journalist . <br><blue>14</blue>At 30 , he resumed his education at Newbattle Abbey College on the mainland , where he came under the tutelage of the poet Edwin Muir , who was also from the Orkneys . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1954 , Mr. Muir wrote the introduction to Mr. Brown 's first collection of poetry , " The Storm and Other Poems . " <br><blue>16</blue>" Loaves and Fishes " was published in 1959 , followed by " The Year of the Whale " and " Fishermen With Plows : A Poem Cycle , " often regarded as his finest poetic work . <br><blue>17</blue>His other books of verse include " Winterfold " and " Poems New and Selected . " <br><blue>18</blue>In the late 1960 's he also began publishing books of short stories , beginning with " A Calendar of Love and Other Stories . " <br><blue>19</blue>Among his other anthologies are " Hawkfall and Other Stories " and " Andrina and Other Stories . " <br><blue>20</blue>The story " Andrina " was made into a telev ' sion film by Bill Forsyth . <br><hr><br><blue>1(6)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Heaney</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>The Listener</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>the Viking warrior</m_str> (3_23) 	<m_str>Seamus Heaney</m_str> (3_9) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (16_34) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_6) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Sheila Gordon</m_str> (8_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_30) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Brown 's imagination</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (3_35) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Orkneys</m_str> (1_41) 	<m_str>the Orkneys</m_str> (5_9) 	<br><blue>6(26)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Brown 's</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Muir</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Brown 's</m_str> (15_10) 	<m_str>the author 's</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Brown 's</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_20) 	<m_str>Mr. Brown</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_31) 	<m_str>Mr. Brown</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>the author</m_str> (8_36) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>the earliest storyteller</m_str> (8_45) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_17) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Andrina</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>Andrina</m_str> (20_4) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
