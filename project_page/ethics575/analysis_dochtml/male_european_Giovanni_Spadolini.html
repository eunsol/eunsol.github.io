<blue>1</blue>Giovanni Spadolini , a former Prime Minister , a prolific author and a stalwart of many Italian administrations , died here today . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 69 . <br><blue>3</blue>His office said he died of respiratory failure while recovering from a stomach operation last month . <br><blue>4</blue>With his bulky , shuffling gait and heavy spectacles , Mr. Spadolini had been a familiar figure for many years in a career that spanned journalism , the academic world and politics . <br><blue>5</blue>On June 10 , 1981 , two years after becoming head of the small Republican Party , he became the first postwar Prime Minister to be drawn from outside the ranks of the Christian Democratic Party . <br><blue>6</blue>He headed two five-party coalitions that fought Red Brigade urban terrorism at the close of the period Italians call the " years of lead . " <br><blue>7</blue>Strength and Politics Despite his long association with the political system that produced Italy 's huge corruption scandal , Mr. Spadolini was never personally implicated in the graft inquiries that have destroyed many political careers . <br><blue>8</blue>His status as a historian and as an editor of Corriere della Sera , the nation 's leading daily , enabled Mr. Sapdoline to project an aura of intellectual strength , political wisdom and sound judgment . <br><blue>9</blue>His membership and longtime leadership of the Republican Party -- a political home favored by intellectuals and business leaders -- also enabled him to depict himself as aloof from corruption . <br><blue>10</blue>Even when the old guard finally collapsed in disgrace in elections last March , Mr. Spadolini came within one vote of being re-elected as Senate speaker . <br><blue>11</blue>A Native of Florence Mr. Spadolini was born in Florence on June 21 , 1925 , and graduated with a law degree from the city 's university 22 years later . <br><blue>12</blue>At 25 he became professor of contemporary history at the university , specializing in Italy 's unification in the 19th century . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1955 he went into journalism to edit Il Resto del Carlino in Bologna . <br><blue>14</blue>He took over at Corriere della Sera 13 years later . <br><blue>15</blue>It was only in 1972 that he entered Parliament , elected as an independent on the Republican Party list in Milan . <br><blue>16</blue>He held a variety of Government jobs -- including the ministries of culture and education -- before he became head of the party in 1979 . <br><blue>17</blue>A Historian 's Project One of his most cherished projects , which he established in 1980 , was Fondazione Nuova Antologia , a historical foundation that has produced specialized publications and houses one of Italy 's greatest collections of historical works . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Spadolini 's period as Prime Minister in 1981 and 1982 was marked by the Red Brigades ' kidnapping and subsequent release of an American general , James Lee Dozier ; the Mafia assassination of Pio La Torre , a leading Communist official in Sicily ; the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano , and investigations into P-2 , a spurious Masonic lodge suspected of plotting against the Government . <br><blue>19</blue>A 1985 official biography of Mr. Spadolini , issued after he spent two years as Defense Minister , said his administrations " saw the victory of political democracy over terrorism . " <br><blue>20</blue>He became Speaker of the Senate in 1987 and was made a Senator-for-life in 1991 . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the city 's university 22 years later</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>the university</m_str> (12_10) 	<br><blue>2(11)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_20) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Senate</m_str> (20_5) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Florence</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>Florence</m_str> (11_4) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>many Italian administrations</m_str> (1_16) 	<m_str>his administrations</m_str> (19_20) 	<br><blue>6(19)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Spadolini</m_str> (4_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Spadolini</m_str> (7_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Sapdoline</m_str> (8_22) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (9_23) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (9_26) 	<m_str>the old guard</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>Mr. Spadolini</m_str> (10_15) 	<m_str>Florence Mr. Spadolini</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Spadolini 's</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Spadolini</m_str> (19_6) 	<br><blue>7(5)</blue>: <m_str>the small Republican Party</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>the Christian Democratic Party</m_str> (5_33) 	<m_str>the Republican Party</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>the Republican Party</m_str> (15_16) 	<m_str>the party</m_str> (16_22) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>Italy 's</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>Italy 's</m_str> (12_15) 	<m_str>Italy 's</m_str> (17_35) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
