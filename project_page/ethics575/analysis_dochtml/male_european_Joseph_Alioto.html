<blue>1</blue>Joseph L. Alioto , the two-term Mayor of San Francisco during the city 's most dynamic growth in the late 1960 's and early 1970 's and a lawyer who earned millions of dollars with the nation 's largest civil antitrust practice , died yesterday at his home in San Francisco . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 81 and had prostate cancer , but family members said he died of pneumonia . <br><blue>3</blue>Even in a city that prides itself on its colorful citizenry , Joseph Lawrence Alioto stood out , from his childhood as the son of a Sicilian immigrant working on his father 's boats at Fisherman 's Wharf to his law school days as a scholarship student and on through his rough-and-tumble political and legal careers . <br><blue>4</blue>Those careers brought him great rewards but they also eventually contributed to his estrangement from some of his children , the bitter breakup of his family law firm and a divorce from his first wife , who disappeared for a time in 1974 and returned to complain that she had been taken for granted as a political wife . <br><blue>5</blue>It was the dark side of what in many ways is a classic story of immigrant success in America . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Alioto 's father , Giuseppe , had sailed from Palermo at the age of 9 and later found work on fishing boats in San Francisco Bay . <br><blue>7</blue>As a young man , he married Domenica Lazio , the daughter of Sicilian immigrants . <br><blue>8</blue>In fact , he was one of three Alioto brothers who married three Lazio sisters , and they and their many children lived in the same three-story apartment building , making it almost impossible for neighbors to sort out which child went with which couple . <br><blue>9</blue>Giuseppe Alioto next started his own wholesale fish business and his brothers opened restaurants . <br><blue>10</blue>Joseph Alioto went on to graduate magna cum laude from St. Mary 's College in Moraga , Calif. , in 1937 and was awarded a scholarship to law school at Catholic University in Washington . <br><blue>11</blue>After graduating in 1940 , he became an antitrust lawyer for the Government and then , when the United States entered World War II , he went to the Board of Economic Warfare , where he studied German , Italian and Japanese cartels to help determine which factories to bomb . <br><blue>12</blue>After the war , Mr. Alioto used his antitrust experience to represent movie producers Samuel Goldwyn , Walt Disney and Walter Wanger in suits against the studios and theaters that charged them with monopolistic practices . <br><blue>13</blue>From 1964 to 1966 , he won more than $ 61 million in damages , mostly for clients challenging big companies in price-fixing cases . <br><blue>14</blue>The fees made him wealthy and he invested in businesses through his company , Alioto Enterprises . <br><blue>15</blue>Until Mr. Alioto came along , antitrust cases generally were brought by Government agencies . '' <br><blue>16</blue>We established the nation 's laws that protect private entrepreneurs from monopolistic practices , '' Mr. Alioto told The San Francisco Examiner . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Alioto married the former Angelina Genaro of Dallas in 1941 and they had six children . <br><blue>18</blue>He was little known as a candidate when he entered the 1967 race for mayor of San Francisco but he staged a whirlwind 56-day campaign to become only the third Democratic mayor of the city in 60 years . <br><blue>19</blue>He was elected largely with the support of labor unions and minorities , though he managed to draw the votes of many Republican middle-class homeowners . <br><blue>20</blue>Angela Alioto , who remained devoted to her father in the face of family turmoil and who followed him into politics as a member of the Board of Supervisors , remembered Mr. Alioto 's entrance into politics in a recent interview . <br><hr><br><blue>1(5)</blue>: <m_str>San Francisco</m_str> (1_50) 	<m_str>San Francisco</m_str> (1_9) 	<m_str>the city 's</m_str> (1_12) 	<m_str>San Francisco Bay</m_str> (6_25) 	<m_str>San Francisco</m_str> (18_17) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Angela Alioto , who remained devoted to her father in the face of family turmoil and who followed him into politics as a member of the Board of Supervisors</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_8) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>Washington</m_str> (10_34) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>which couple</m_str> (8_44) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Domenica Lazio , the daughter of Sicilian immigrants</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>Lazio</m_str> (8_14) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (7_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_4) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>itself</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (3_9) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (8_20) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>We</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>The San Francisco Examiner</m_str> (16_19) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the nation 's</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>the nation 's</m_str> (16_3) 	<br><blue>11(41)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_47) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (2_13) 	<m_str>Joseph Lawrence Alioto</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_20) 	<m_str>the son of a Sicilian</m_str> (3_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_31) 	<m_str>his father 's</m_str> (3_31) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_40) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_51) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_33) 	<m_str>Mr. Alioto 's</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Alioto 's father , Giuseppe</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>Alioto</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>Giuseppe Alioto</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>Joseph Alioto</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_36) 	<m_str>Mr. Alioto</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Alioto</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Alioto</m_str> (16_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Alioto</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_20) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_15) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (20_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Alioto 's</m_str> (20_32) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>three Alioto brothers</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>his brothers</m_str> (9_11) 	<br><blue>13(3)</blue>: <m_str>legal careers</m_str> (3_55) 	<m_str>Those careers</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (4_8) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
