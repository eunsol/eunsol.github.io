<blue>1</blue>Art Fleming , a tall , dignified actor who brought a generation of couch potatoes to attention and became an unlikely celebrity as the original host of the television quiz show " Jeopardy! , " died on Tuesday at his home in Crystal River , Fla . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 70 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was pancreatic cancer , his family said . <br><blue>4</blue>The popularity of " Jeopardy! , " which went on the air in 1964 , has been attributed to its unsettling format , in which questions are posed as answers and the answers must be expressed as questions . <br><blue>5</blue>Then again , it was Mr. Fleming who gave " Jeopardy! " its face and its voice , not to mention its dignified posture . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Fleming , who had the carriage of a gentleman soldier and the manner of a benign schoolmaster , seemed just the sort of host who would n't be resented for knowing , say , that it was Henry of Navarre who thought Paris well worth a mass in 1593 . <br><blue>7</blue>Merv Griffin , who created " Jeopardy! , " recalled yesterday that he had recruited Mr. Fleming after spotting him in an airline commercial and deciding that the actor had " the perfect look and command " for the show . <br><blue>8</blue>" He built a huge cult following , which has stayed with the show all these years , " Mr. Griffin said . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Fleming , who served as the show 's host throughout its initial run on NBC , from 1964 to 1974 , and then for two more years when it was revamped in 1978 as " The All New Jeopardy , " became so identified with " Jeopardy! " that it continued to give him a comfortable living . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Fleming , who was also the host of the " College Bowl " quiz show for seven years , was passed over in favor of Alex Trebek , the current host , when " Jeopardy! " was revived in 1984 . <br><blue>11</blue>But he continued to make as many as 80 highly paid appearances a year as a host of mock " Jeopardy! " games staged by trade associations and other private groups . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Fleming , who was born in New York City , was the son of a popular Austrian dance team , William and Marie Fazzin , who had come to New York with the intention of captivating American audiences . <br><blue>13</blue>Their dream faded , but by the age of 4 , their son was appearing in a Broadway musical . <br><blue>14</blue>After studying at Colgate and Cornell Universities and serving as a Navy pilot in World War II , Mr. Fleming returned to New York City as an actor . <br><blue>15</blue>By his own count , he appeared in more than 5,000 radio and television episodes and 48 movies . <br><blue>16</blue>He also made commercials and acted on the stage . <br><blue>17</blue>He is survived by his wife , Rebecca ; a daughter , Jan Marie Hanna of Hampton Bays , L.I. ; a sister , Marie Vitt of Larchmont , N.Y. , who appeared on the Broadway stage as Marie Foster ; two stepchildren , and five grandchildren . <br><hr><br><blue>1(6)</blue>: <m_str>the air</m_str> (4_11) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (4_20) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (5_4) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (5_22) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>captivating American audiences</m_str> (12_37) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>Their</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>3(5)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_40) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>his family</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>the actor</m_str> (7_28) 	<br><blue>4(9)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Fleming</m_str> (7_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Fleming , who was also the host of the `` College Bowl '' quiz show for seven years</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Fleming , who was born in New York City</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Fleming</m_str> (14_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_5) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the stage</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>the Broadway stage</m_str> (17_35) 	<br><blue>6(7)</blue>: <m_str>the show</m_str> (7_39) 	<m_str>the show</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>the show 's</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (9_30) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (9_51) 	<m_str>the `` College Bowl '' quiz show</m_str> (10_10) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Broadway</m_str> (13_18) 	<m_str>Broadway</m_str> (17_36) 	<br><blue>8(7)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>Merv Griffin , who created `` Jeopardy! , ''</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (7_20) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Griffin</m_str> (8_20) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (9_55) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_2) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
