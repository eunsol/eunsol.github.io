<blue>1</blue>Former United States Representative James M. Hanley , a liberal Democrat who served eight terms in the House representing a district comprising Syracuse and upstate New York counties , died on Oct. 16 in Geddes , N.Y . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 83 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Hanley , who was a funeral director and owner of a funeral home , was first elected to Congress in 1964 , in the landslide of Lyndon B. Johnson . <br><blue>4</blue>In a dramatic upset , Mr. Hanley ousted a veteran Republican incumbent , R. Walter Riehlman . <br><blue>5</blue>In the next 16 years , Mr. Hanley was often said to be in danger of losing his constituency , which had twice as many enrolled Republicans as enrolled Democrats . <br><blue>6</blue>But he was re-elected to the House seven times , paving the way for Democrats in traditionally Republican central New York . <br><blue>7</blue>In 1980 , when he announced that he would not seek re-election , his 32nd District comprised Syracuse , half of Onondaga County , and all of Cortland , Madison and Chenango Counties . <br><blue>8</blue>He said that 16 years was '' enough time to spend '' in Congress and that the time to leave any undertaking was '' when you are on top . '' <br><blue>9</blue>In his first term in Congress , Mr. Hanley wrote a successful amendment to the legislation that established Medicare . <br><blue>10</blue>During President Johnson 's administration , from 1963 to 1969 , Mr. Hanley was an early supporter of Medicare , the Elementary and Secondary Education Act , the Head Start program and the '' war on poverty . '' <br><blue>11</blue>As part of Congress 's Democratic majority , he became known for getting federal money passed to the 32nd District . <br><blue>12</blue>Syracuse 's federal building was constructed while he was in the House and was renamed , for him , after his retirement . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Hanley said he did not approve of abortion , but he did not endorse a right-to-life amendment to the Constitution . <br><blue>14</blue>He backed the Equal Rights Amendment in 1971 , when it was an important part of the women 's rights movement . <br><blue>15</blue>When he stepped down , he was chairman of the House Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight and the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee . <br><blue>16</blue>He was one of only two representatives from New York State to hold full chairmanships of committees in the House at that time . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Hanley said he was sorry that he was leaving office without seeing the creation of a federal program for renewed support of the United States Postal Service . <br><blue>18</blue>After leaving the House , he was a consultant in Washington for a decade and then moved back to Syracuse . <br><blue>19</blue>James Michael Hanley was born on July 19 , 1920 , in Syracuse . <br><blue>20</blue>He graduated from St. Lucy 's Academy in Syracuse and served in the Army during World War II . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>Congress</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>Congress</m_str> (9_6) 	<m_str>Congress 's</m_str> (11_4) 	<br><blue>2(30)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Hanley , who was a funeral director and owner of a funeral home</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Hanley</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Hanley</m_str> (5_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Hanley</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Hanley</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_8) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (12_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_21) 	<m_str>Mr. Hanley</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Hanley</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_6) 	<m_str>James Michael Hanley</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Medicare</m_str> (9_19) 	<m_str>Medicare</m_str> (10_19) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Lyndon B.
