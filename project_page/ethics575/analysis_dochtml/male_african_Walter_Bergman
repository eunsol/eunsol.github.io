<blue>1</blue>Dr. Walter Bergman , an indefatigable civil rights advocate who was savagely beaten by members of the Ku Klux Klan in 1961 as one of the first Freedom Riders and won compensation for the attack from the F.B.I. more than two decades later , died on Sept. 29 in a nursing home in Grand Rapids , Mich. , his wife said . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 100 . <br><blue>3</blue>He suffered a stroke 10 days after the beating and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life . <br><blue>4</blue>In 1983 , after an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation had testified that the agency had ignored warnings of the impending attack , Dr. Bergman won a damage suit against the Federal Government , though he was awarded only $ 35,000 of the $ 2 million he had sought . '' <br><blue>5</blue>The suit righted the essential history of the period , '' said Howard L. Simon , who was executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Michigan when the suit was tried . '' <br><blue>6</blue>It proved the Federal Government was not an ally of the civil rights worker , but in fact was in league with local law enforcement and the K.K.K. '' The attack and its aftermath were emblematic of a life lived at the barricades of social activism . <br><blue>7</blue>By profession an educator , Dr. Bergman over the years took such controversial stands as declaring in a public debate in 1935 that the New Deal was too timid in its attack on poverty , and that the United Auto Workers was wrong to bar officials from claiming their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when asked about Communist leanings . <br><blue>8</blue>He was a founder of both the Michigan chapter of the A.C.L.U. and the Michigan Federation of Teachers . <br><blue>9</blue>In 1953 , the State Department seized his passport while he was teaching at the International People 's College in Elsinore , Denmark . <br><blue>10</blue>His wife , Patricia , said the reason was a trip he had made to the Soviet Union to study that country 's educational system . <br><blue>11</blue>After protests by civil liberties groups and education organizations , the passport was quickly restored . <br><blue>12</blue>Dr. Bergman , the son of a Swedish immigrant farmer , was the third of three siblings born in Youngsville , Pa . <br><blue>13</blue>He graduated from high school at 15 , and attended Greenville College in Greenville , Ill . <br><blue>14</blue>He was drafted into the Army during World War I and served in the Signal Corps , where he learned to fly . <br><blue>15</blue>The war ended before he could participate in combat , and he was sent to Germany to help administer the Allied occupation . <br><blue>16</blue>Seeing the devastation , he became a pacifist . <br><blue>17</blue>He returned to a factory job in Youngsville , then began teaching in Cherry Creek , N.Y . <br><blue>18</blue>He moved to Detroit , where he taught high school classes and studied nights at the University of Michigan to earn a master 's degree and then a doctorate in education . <br><blue>19</blue>He rose to research director of the Detroit school system and taught education at the system 's universities , which were later merged into Wayne State University . <br><blue>20</blue>During World War II , he received conscientious objector status , but later enlisted to participate in what he had come to believe was a moral war against Hitler . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the system 's</m_str> (19_15) 	<m_str>the Detroit school system</m_str> (19_7) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>the F.B.I.</m_str> (1_37) 	<br><blue>3(26)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (14_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_59) 	<m_str>Dr. Bergman , the son of a Swedish immigrant farmer</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Bergman</m_str> (4_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_38) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_49) 	<m_str>Dr. Bergman over the years</m_str> (7_6) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>the A.C.L.U.</m_str> (8_11) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (7_31) 	<m_str>the Federal Government</m_str> (4_33) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (6_33) 	<m_str>the Federal Government</m_str> (6_3) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>His wife , Patricia</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his wife</m_str> (1_59) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Youngsville</m_str> (12_20) 	<m_str>Youngsville</m_str> (17_8) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>his passport</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>the passport</m_str> (11_11) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>The war</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>World War</m_str> (14_8) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>the beating</m_str> (3_8) 	<br><blue>11(3)</blue>: <m_str>the attack</m_str> (1_34) 	<m_str>its attack</m_str> (7_31) 	<m_str>the impending attack</m_str> (4_22) 	<br><blue>12(4)</blue>: <m_str>a damage suit</m_str> (4_29) 	<m_str>the suit</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>The suit</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (6_1) 	<br><blue>13(1)</blue>: <m_str>Detroit</m_str> (19_8) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>Michigan</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>Michigan</m_str> (5_28) 	<br><blue>15(1)</blue>: <m_str>the agency</m_str> (4_16) 	<br><blue>16(2)</blue>: <m_str>the University of Michigan</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>Wayne State University</m_str> (19_25) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
