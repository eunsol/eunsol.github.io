<blue>1</blue>Vice President Wang Zhen , a general who rose through the Communist ranks to become one of China 's most powerful leaders and among the hardest of the hard-liners , died this afternoon of an unspecified ailment , the official New China News Agency announced today . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 85 and had been unwell for more than a year . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Wang , who had only a third-grade education , has been a scourge of writers and free-thinkers for the last 50 years , and Chinese intellectuals detested few people among the Communist leadership as Mr. Wang . <br><blue>4</blue>Although Mr. Wang 's death will weaken the hard-liners ' hold on the leadership , it is unlikely to have a major political impact , in part because he already had been very feeble . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Wang was scheduled to retire as Vice President at the National People 's Congress that is to convene next week . <br><blue>6</blue>The Communist Party Central Commitee tonight mourned Mr. Wang as " a great proletarian revolutionary , statesman and soldier , a staunch Marxist , and an outstanding leader of the party and state . " <br><blue>7</blue>A small , thin man with an outgoing manner and an easy grin , Wang Zhen was in his own way one of the most constant of China 's leaders . <br><blue>8</blue>While most top leaders -- including virtually all of those with reputations as " reformers " -- take cover when political tides are going against them , Mr. Wang was a vitriolic hard-liner even when his views were out of fashion . <br><blue>9</blue>Defended Mao 's Portrait In the relatively open days of 1988 , for example , there was some talk of taking the portrait of Chairman Mao down from Tiananmen , the gate in the center of the city . <br><blue>10</blue>" If the portrait is removed , I will never again go to Tiananmen Square , " Mr. Wang declared at the time to a top party officials . <br><blue>11</blue>Today the portrait still hangs on Tiananmen and overlooks the square . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Wang spoke in the pungent language of a peasant , spicing his speech with phrases that caused eyes of more urbane officials to bulge . <br><blue>13</blue>He often inveighed against rock music and against literature that did not serve the party . <br><blue>14</blue>While the position of vice president is supposed to be a largely symbolic one in China , Mr. Wang invested it with new importance by transforming it into a bully pulpit from which to preach his Maoist views . <br><blue>15</blue>He enthusiastically backed the 1989 crackdown against the Tiananmen democracy movement , and he is believed to have urged unsuccessfully that special prison camps be established in the wilderness along China 's frigid northern border to house recalcitrant intellectuals . <br><blue>16</blue>After his health began to fail in late 1991 , Mr. Wang rarely appeared in public . <br><blue>17</blue>He had difficulty speaking clearly , and he had limited control of his bladder . <br><blue>18</blue>Characteristically , his incontinence distressed him less than it did the sophisticated Foreign Ministry officials who accompanied him on meetings with visiting foreigners . <br><blue>19</blue>Premature Reports of Death One university-educated Chinese official who is also a party member said that he and his circle of friends probably hated Mr. Wang more than any other official . <br><blue>20</blue>He said that he and a group of others began cheering spontaneously a couple of years ago when they believed that Mr. Wang had died -- they had been listening to a news report announcing the death of Huang Zhen , a senior Communist official whose name is pronounced only a bit differently from Mr. Wang 's . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (8_26) 	<m_str>most top leaders -- including virtually all of those with reputations as `` reformers ''
