<blue>1</blue>Edmund S. Muskie , the charming if often volatile Democrat from Maine who served as his state 's Governor , as United States Senator and briefly as Secretary of State , died early today at the Georgetown University Medical Center . <br><blue>2</blue>He would have been 82 on Thursday . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Muskie 's assistant , Carole Parmelee , said he suffered a heart attack in the hospital on Thursday after a successful operation on March 18 to clear a blocked artery in his right leg . <br><blue>4</blue>He never regained consciousness , she said . <br><blue>5</blue>President Clinton praised Mr. Muskie as " a dedicated legislator and caring public servant . " <br><blue>6</blue>He took special note of the plain-spoken New Englander 's involvement with environmental issues , declaring that " generations to come will benefit from his steadfast commitment to protecting the land . " <br><blue>7</blue>Although Mr. Muskie occupied the political spotlight for three decades , first regionally and then nationally , he fell short in two bids for higher office . <br><blue>8</blue>Nominated for Vice President in 1968 , with the country riven by conflict over Vietnam , he seemed to many a more independent , more credible candidate than Hubert H. Humphrey , the Democratic Presidential nominee , who was dogged by his links to the unpopular policies of President Lyndon B. Johnson . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Muskie caught people 's imagination by inviting hecklers onto the stage with him . <br><blue>10</blue>People compared the 6-foot-4-inch Mr. Muskie to Abraham Lincoln so often that he grew to hate the adjective " Lincolnesque , " but the Humphrey-Muskie ticket lost a close election to Richard M. Nixon and Spiro T. Agnew . <br><blue>11</blue>Dirty Trick Behind a Setback Four years later , with endorsements from most of the nation 's leading Democratic politicians , Mr. Muskie was considered a prohibitive favorite for the Presidential nomination . <br><blue>12</blue>His reputation for probity , many politicians felt , would give him a good chance against Mr. Nixon , who long before the Watergate break-in in June 1972 , had been suspected of political dirty tricks by many voters . <br><blue>13</blue>As it turned out , such a trick played a role in an incident that helped doom the man from Maine . <br><blue>14</blue>All through the New Hampshire primary campaign in 1972 , the conservative Manchester Union Leader attacked him , partly on the basis of an anonymous letter accusing him of using the derogatory term " Canuck " in referring to the state 's French Canadians . <br><blue>15</blue>It emerged later that the letter had been sent to the paper by Kenneth W. Clawson , a political aide to Mr. Nixon . <br><blue>16</blue>The Union Leader also ran an article that accused Mr. Muskie 's wife , Jane , of smoking , drinking and cursing in an " unladylike " way , in a day when the private lives of politicians , to say nothing of politicians ' wives , were mostly private . <br><blue>17</blue>He finally ran out of patience on the next-to-last Saturday before the primary . <br><blue>18</blue>Exhausted from a cross-country trip , Mr. Muskie learned of the " Canuck " article on arriving in Manchester . <br><blue>19</blue>Standing on a flatbed truck outside the Union Leader building , snow falling on his bare head , hands jammed into his overcoat pockets , shoulders heaving , Mr. Muskie passionately defended his wife , castigated the newspaper and its publisher , and then began to weep -- or so many reporters believed . <br><blue>20</blue>He won in New Hampshire , as he had won in preliminary caucuses in Arizona and Iowa , but in none was his margin as large as anticipated . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>New Hampshire</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>New Hampshire</m_str> (20_4) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>an anonymous letter accusing him of using the derogatory term `` Canuck '' in referring to the state 's French Canadians</m_str> (14_24) 	<m_str>the letter</m_str> (15_5) 	<br><blue>3(8)</blue>: <m_str>The Union Leader</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_33) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_22) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_23) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_8) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Maine</m_str> (1_12) 	<m_str>Maine</m_str> (13_21) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>President Lyndon B.
