<blue>1</blue>Lindsay Anderson , the British film and theater director whose distaste for conformity and class-conscious English tradition informed such anarchic films as ' If . . . " and " O Lucky Man ! <br><blue>2</blue>, " died on Tuesday in the Dordogne region of France , where he was vacationing . <br><blue>3</blue>He was 71 and lived in London . <br><blue>4</blue>The cause was a heart attack , said a friend , Mike Kaplan , a producer . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Anderson made a name for himself as a cinema rebel during the 1960 's and 70 's . <br><blue>6</blue>He was also considered an innovative theater director , and was the artistic director of the Royal Court theater in London from 1969 to 1975 . <br><blue>7</blue>He also fostered new writing as a founding member of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court . <br><blue>8</blue>" He was a man of great talent and formidable intelligence , " said Mr. Kaplan , who produced Mr. Anderson 's 1987 film " The Whales of August , " which provided a last screen showcase for Bette Davis and Lillian Gish . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Anderson 's first feature film was the influential " This Sporting Life " ( 1963 ) , which explored the socially restrictive society of a Northern English town through the eyes of a coal miner turned rugby player . <br><blue>10</blue>It starred Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts , both of whom received Oscar nominations . <br><blue>11</blue>Mistakes Were ' First-Class ' In 1969 , his second feature , " If . . . , ' took an insurrectionary view of Britain with a tale of a boarding-school rebel , played by Malcolm McDowell , who rises up against the establishment . <br><blue>12</blue>Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times that the film " is so good and strong that even those things in the movie that strike one as being first-class mistakes are of more interest than entire movies made by smoothly consistent , lesser directors . " <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. McDowell said yesterday of Mr. Anderson : " He was a very , very important man in my life . <br><blue>14</blue>He started me off as an actor in film . <br><blue>15</blue>The sad thing is he was itching to do something in the last few years but could never raise the money , and now it 's too late . " <br><blue>16</blue>Other Anderson films include " In Celebration " ( 1975 ) , adapted from the David Storey play about three brothers who return to the coal-mining town of their youth , and " Britannia Hospital " ( 1982 ) , a blackly comic satire in which a chaotic hospital serves as a metaphor for a decaying Britain . <br><blue>17</blue>He also appeared as a cameo actor in a number of films , making what Mr. Canby described in a review as a " brief , richly funny appearance " as a Cambridge schoolmaster in " Chariots of Fire " in 1981 . <br><blue>18</blue>' Like Being a Lion Tamer ' Mr. Anderson was considered a fascinating mixture : a self-disciplined anarchist and a likable paternalist . <br><blue>19</blue>He was once quoted as saying that his own definition of a movie director was " like being a lion tamer , " with the explanation that " when the lion tamer goes into the cage , he has to give an impression of absolute confidence and relaxation even if he is terrified 10 minutes before . " <br><blue>20</blue>He was born in 1923 in Bangalore , India , where his father was a soldier . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Canby</m_str> (17_16) 	<m_str>Vincent Canby</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>Anderson 's 1987 film</m_str> (8_21) 	<m_str>the film</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Anderson 's first feature film</m_str> (9_1) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Royal Court</m_str> (6_17) 	<m_str>the Royal Court</m_str> (7_16) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (6_21) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>my</m_str> (13_19) 	<m_str>me</m_str> (14_3) 	<m_str>Malcolm McDowell , who rises up against the establishment</m_str> (11_34) 	<m_str>Mr. McDowell</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the money</m_str> (15_20) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (15_25) 	<br><blue>7(23)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_8) 	<m_str>Anderson</m_str> (16_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Anderson</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Anderson 's</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (5_7) 	<m_str>Anderson 's</m_str> (8_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Anderson</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_38) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (2_14) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_51) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>a Lion Tamer ' Mr. Anderson</m_str> (18_4) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
