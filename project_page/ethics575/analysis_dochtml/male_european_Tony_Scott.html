<blue>1</blue>Tony Scott , a distinguished jazz clarinetist who in the 1950s helped steer his instrument out of the swing era and into the sax-infested waters of bebop , died on Wednesday at his home in Rome . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 85 and had lived in Italy for many years . <br><blue>3</blue>The apparent cause was complications of the prostate cancer Mr. Scott had many years ago , his wife , Cinzia , said . <br><blue>4</blue>With Buddy DeFranco , Mr. Scott was considered one of the leading bebop clarinetists . <br><blue>5</blue>( The two men were often described as the only major clarinetists to take on bebop , a style thought to be incompatible with the instrument 's soft , sweet sound . ) <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Scott , who also played the saxophone , performed and recorded with some of the titans of mid-20th-century jazz , among them Duke Ellington , Ben Webster , Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday . <br><blue>7</blue>If Mr. Scott was not widely known to the American public , it was partly because his eclectic style made him unclassifiable : over the years , he ranged through bebop and what today would be called New Age and world music . <br><blue>8</blue>It was also because he was peripatetic : for decades he roamed the globe , clarinet in hand . <br><blue>9</blue>He had lived mostly abroad since the late '50s . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Scott was also well regarded as a composer and arranger . <br><blue>11</blue>His composition '' Blues for Charlie Parker , '' which he created extemporaneously at a concert in Yugoslavia in 1957 , became his most-requested number . <br><blue>12</blue>He also arranged hits like '' The Banana Boat Song ( Day-O ) '' for Harry Belafonte . <br><blue>13</blue>In a profile of Mr. Scott in The New York Times in 1967 , John S. Wilson described him '' playing his clarinet in his own uncompromisingly distinctive manner , a manner which encompasses both a feathery , light-as-air impressionism and an intense , emotional ferocity that makes the old-time ' hot ' men sound as though they were blowing icicles . '' <br><blue>14</blue>By the end of the 1940s , the swing style popularized by Benny Goodman was on the wane , and the clarinet was falling out of favor as a jazz instrument . <br><blue>15</blue>Mr. Scott persevered , touring Sweden , South Africa , Senegal , the Philippines , Malaysia , Indonesia , Japan and elsewhere . <br><blue>16</blue>His 1964 album '' Music for Zen Meditation '' ( Verve ) , a collaboration with traditional Japanese musicians , is considered an early example of New Age music . <br><blue>17</blue>Among his other albums are '' The Touch of Tony Scott '' ( RCA Victor , 1956 ) ; '' The Modern Art of Jazz '' ( Seeco , 1957 ) ; '' Tony Scott in Afrika '' ( A World of Music , 1997 ) ; and '' A Jazz Life '' ( Kind of Blue ) , scheduled for release next month . <br><blue>18</blue>Anthony Joseph Sciacca -- his family name is pronounced '' Shaka '' -- was born on June 17 , 1921 , in Morristown , N.J. , to parents who had come from Sicily . <br><blue>19</blue>His father was a barber and amateur guitarist ; his mother played the violin . <br><blue>20</blue>He began playing the clarinet at 12 and in 1942 earned a diploma from the Juilliard School . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>his instrument</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>the instrument 's</m_str> (5_25) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>many years</m_str> (2_10) 	<m_str>the years</m_str> (7_25) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>a style</m_str> (5_18) 	<m_str>his eclectic style</m_str> (7_17) 	<m_str>the swing style popularized by Benny Goodman</m_str> (14_8) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>New Age</m_str> (7_38) 	<m_str>New Age</m_str> (16_27) 	<br><blue>5(33)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Scott</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Scott</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Scott , who also played the saxophone</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_17) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (7_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>Mr. Scott</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Scott</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_23) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Scott in The New York Times in 1967</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>John S.
