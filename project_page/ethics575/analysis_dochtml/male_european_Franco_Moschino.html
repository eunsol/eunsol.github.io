<blue>1</blue>Franco Moschino , the Italian designer known for bringing humor and irreverence to fashion , died on Sunday in a country house he had rented in Annone , Italy , outside Milan , where he lived and worked . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 44 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause of death was cardiac arrest associated with complications from an abdominal tumor , said Marco Gobbetti , the general manager of the Moschino fashion house . <br><blue>4</blue>His last show , in October 1993 , was a 10-year retrospective that ended with a stage filled with men , women and children dressed in white and wearing AIDS ribbons . <br><blue>5</blue>It was followed by a retrospective exhibition in Milan 's Museo della Permanente called " X Years of Kaos . " <br><blue>6</blue>A coffee-table book with the same title and featuring Moschino 's clothing designs , paintings and advertising campaigns was published in Italy by Edizioni Lybra Immagine . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Moschino was as much social commentator as designer , delighting in ridiculing the excesses of the 1980 's with whimsical appliques , logos and slogans . <br><blue>8</blue>His humor often took the form of outrageous sendups of fashion icons like the Chanel suit , which he once parodied by embroidering the words " This is a Waist of Money " where the traditional gold chain belt would have been . <br><blue>9</blue>" He put humor into fashion , but at a high-quality level , " said Kalman Ruttenstein , the vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale 's , which has an in-store Moschino boutique . <br><blue>10</blue>" The Moschino style was established in a few short years and is easily recognized the world over . " <br><blue>11</blue>The designer himself became easily recognized after his mustached , crew-cut image was used in advertising campaigns that pictured him in a variety of guises including Popeye , a Mafioso , a child and a transvestite . <br><blue>12</blue>Strongly influenced by the Surrealist art movement of the 1920 's , Mr. Moschino was known to decorate a dinner suit with real cutlery , to use dozens of miniature teddy bears as a hat and scarf , to fashion the bodice of a strapless dress totally of gold safety pins and to make a skirt that was nothing but vertical rows of zippers . <br><blue>13</blue>He covered the backs of jackets with images like a pair of women 's eyes or an oversize playing card . <br><blue>14</blue>He once showed a man 's white shirt with exaggeratedly long sleeves that were wrapped around the body to simulate a straitjacket . <br><blue>15</blue>On the back were the words " For Fashion Victims Only . " <br><blue>16</blue>He also made totally wearable , well-cut suits and dresses that he showed with wildly crazy hats fashioned like a bishop 's miter , an airplane , a giant light bulb or an assemblage of life preservers . <br><blue>17</blue>" I 'm not a fashion designer , " Mr. Moschino was quoted as saying in a 1991 article in The New York Times . <br><blue>18</blue>" I 'm a painter ; a decorator . <br><blue>19</blue>I 'm not the author of a new era . " <br><blue>20</blue>He indeed was a painter and fashion illustrator before taking his first job as a designer in 1976 for an Italian ready-to-wear company called Cadette . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Italy</m_str> (1_29) 	<m_str>Italy</m_str> (6_22) 	<br><blue>2(16)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (1_23) 	<m_str>Franco Moschino , the Italian designer known for bringing humor and irreverence to fashion</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Moschino 's</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Moschino</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_19) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>Moschino</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_8) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (11_20) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (11_3) 	<m_str>Mr. Moschino</m_str> (12_13) 	<m_str>Mr. Moschino</m_str> (17_10) 	<br><blue>3(9)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_12) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_11) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>a retrospective exhibition in Milan 's Museo della Permanente called `` X Years of Kaos</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>This</m_str> (8_27) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
