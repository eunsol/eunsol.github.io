<blue>1</blue>Otto Rosenberg , a German Gypsy who survived Nazi persecution and described it in a volume of memoirs , '' A Gypsy in Auschwitz , '' died last Thursday in Berlin , the German newspaper Berliner Zeitung has reported . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 74 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause of death was not immediately disclosed . <br><blue>4</blue>While Jews were the Holocaust 's main victims , Gypsies were also killed . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Rosenberg , one of 11 siblings in a German Gypsy family that had settled in Berlin , was the only one in his immediate family , besides his mother , to survive the war . <br><blue>6</blue>Most were annihilated at Auschwitz . <br><blue>7</blue>Otto Rosenberg 's memoirs , written in collaboration with Ulrich Enzensberger , were published in English in 1999 in Britain after appearing in German in 1998 . <br><blue>8</blue>They were praised by the British journal History Today as '' a haunting account of the author 's life '' in the years of the Third Reich '' and how he was subjected to deprivation , abuse and cruelty at a tragically early age . '' <br><blue>9</blue>In his last years , Mr. Rosenberg was the chairman , for Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg , of a national organization of German Sinti and Romanies , which are two groupings of Gypsies . <br><blue>10</blue>Otto Rosenberg was born in East Prussia and grew up in Berlin . <br><blue>11</blue>As a child , he was sent in 1936 to what became known as the Gypsy camp in Marzahn , a suburb of Berlin . <br><blue>12</blue>Hundreds of Gypsies were taken there by the police in that year . <br><blue>13</blue>As Guenter Lewy , a retired professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts , wrote recently in his book '' The Nazi Persecution of the Gypsies , '' Gypsies with caravans and even some apartment-dwelling Gypsies were moved to the Marzahn camp '' in order to reinforce Berlin 's appearance as a model city and impress foreign visitors '' to the Olympic Games in Berlin in the summer of 1936 . <br><blue>14</blue>Later Mr. Rosenberg was among the forced laborers in the armaments industry and was interned in the Auschwitz , Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps and elsewhere before being freed in 1945 . <br><blue>15</blue>Looking back on his experiences as a prisoner , he said in 1995 : '' I was very young and healthy , and always fit for work . <br><blue>16</blue>I was probably very lucky , and protected by God . <br><blue>17</blue>The weaker ones died in the hospital or were beaten to death with guns . '' <br><blue>18</blue>In postwar Germany , he played the accordion and guitar at parties and in coffeehouses . <br><blue>19</blue>The first of his two marriages ended in divorce . <br><blue>20</blue>He had seven children . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>The Nazi Persecution of the Gypsies</m_str> (13_23) 	<m_str>Nazi persecution</m_str> (1_9) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (1_13) 	<br><blue>2(9)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (13_20) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>a retired professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_10) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (15_16) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>Auschwitz</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>Auschwitz</m_str> (1_24) 	<m_str>Auschwitz</m_str> (6_5) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>a German Gypsy family</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>his immediate family</m_str> (5_24) 	<br><blue>5(7)</blue>: <m_str>Berlin</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>Berlin</m_str> (13_67) 	<m_str>Berlin</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>Berlin</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>Berlin</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>Marzahn , a suburb of Berlin</m_str> (11_19) 	<m_str>Berlin 's</m_str> (13_50) 	<br><blue>6(7)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Rosenberg</m_str> (9_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Rosenberg</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_29) 	<m_str>Otto Rosenberg 's</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Otto Rosenberg</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_24) 	<br><blue>7(4)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_31) 	<m_str>the author 's</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_2) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>Gypsies</m_str> (9_36) 	<m_str>Gypsies</m_str> (4_10) 	<m_str>Gypsies</m_str> (12_3) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>his last years</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>the years</m_str> (8_22) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
