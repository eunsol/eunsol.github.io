<blue>1</blue>Muriel Spark , known for her finely polished , darkly comic prose and for the unforgettable Miss Jean Brodie , one of the funniest and most sinister characters in modern fiction , died Friday at a hospital in Florence , Italy . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 88 . <br><blue>3</blue>Ms. Spark 's death was announced yesterday , The Associated Press reported , by Massimiliano Dindalini , the mayor of the Tuscan village of Civitella della Chiana , where she had lived for almost 30 years . <br><blue>4</blue>Her work , unlocked from her innermost memories of her experiences before and after her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1954 , built a canon of short , sometimes macabre , sometimes humorous novels that sought to pare away the absurdities of human behavior . <br><blue>5</blue>Ms. Spark 's first novel was published when she was 39 , and after that she supplied a stream of slender novels and enigmatic short stories peopled with such curiosities as narrators from beyond the grave , flying saucers , grandmotherly smugglers with bread bins full of diamond-studded loaves and individuals of so little substance that they disappear when the door closes . <br><blue>6</blue>In her writing , evil is never far away , violence is a regular visitor and death is a constant companion . <br><blue>7</blue>Her themes were generally serious but nearly always handled with a feather-light touch . <br><blue>8</blue>It is this lightness , and a contrived detachment toward her characters , that became the target of the harshest criticism of her work , which at her death included more than 20 novels , several collections of short stories , poetry , criticism , biography , plays and a handful of children 's books . <br><blue>9</blue>Some accused her of coolness and even cruelty toward the characters she invented and then sent -- sometimes quite merrily -- to terrible deaths . '' <br><blue>10</blue>People say my novels are cruel because cruel things happen and I keep this even tone , '' she said in an interview in The New Yorker . '' <br><blue>11</blue>I 'm often very deadpan , but there 's a moral statement too , and what it 's saying is that there 's a life beyond this , and these events are not the most important things . <br><blue>12</blue>They 're not important in the long run . '' <br><blue>13</blue>She was born Muriel Sarah Camberg in Edinburgh on Feb. 1 , 1918 , the daughter of Bernard Camberg , an engineer whose Jewish family had settled earlier in Scotland , and his wife , the former Sarah Elizabeth Maud Uezzell , a Protestant from a country village near London . <br><blue>14</blue>When she was 5 she began attending James Gillespie 's High School for Girls , where she became one of the crème de la crème of students selected for a specialized and somewhat unorthodox curriculum by Christina Kay , the teacher who would become the model for the protagonist in '' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie '' ( 1961 ) , which was later adapted for the stage and film . <br><blue>15</blue>Muriel Camberg acquired her Spark from her brief , and as she had put it , '' disastrous , '' marriage at the age of 19 to Sydney Oswald Spark , 13 years her senior , who was about to leave Scotland to teach in Africa . <br><blue>16</blue>He was known as S. O. S. , a fitting nickname , it turned out , when his mental instability and violence led her to end the marriage after seven miserable years . '' <br><blue>17</blue>He became a borderline case , and I did n't like what I found on either side of the border , '' she wrote in her 1992 autobiography , '' Curriculum Vitae . '' <br><blue>18</blue>They lived in Southern Rhodesia ( now Zimbabwe ) , and their union produced her only child , a son , Robin . <br><blue>19</blue>She kept the name Spark , partly for her son 's sake and partly because she thought it had '' some ingredient of life and of fun . '' <br><blue>20</blue>She longed to return to Britain , but she was trapped in Rhodesia for most of World War II because of wartime restrictions on travel . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>an engineer whose Jewish family had settled earlier in Scotland</m_str> (13_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_33) 	<br><blue>2(39)</blue>: <m_str>Muriel Camberg</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_12) 	<m_str>Muriel Spark</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_34) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_24) 	<m_str>Ms. Spark 's</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (17_23) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_26) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_15) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_10) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (3_30) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_15) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (19_16) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Spark 's</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_9) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_23) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_28) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_19) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>Muriel Sarah Camberg</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_17) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Scotland</m_str> (15_42) 	<m_str>Scotland</m_str> (13_30) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Ms. Spark 's first novel</m_str> (5_1) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Edinburgh</m_str> (13_8) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>39</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>that</m_str> (5_15) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>the stage</m_str> (14_68) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_13) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>more than 20 novels , several collections of short stories , poetry , criticism , biography</m_str> (8_31) 	<m_str>my novels</m_str> (10_3) 	<br><blue>11(1)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (13_50) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>They</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (18_12) 	<br><blue>13(1)</blue>: <m_str>her 1992 autobiography</m_str> (17_26) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>a son , Robin</m_str> (18_19) 	<m_str>her son 's</m_str> (19_9) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (19_18) 	<m_str>partly for her son 's sake</m_str> (19_7) 	<br><blue>16(2)</blue>: <m_str>her death</m_str> (8_28) 	<m_str>Ms. Spark 's death</m_str> (3_1) 	<br><blue>17(1)</blue>: <m_str>Africa</m_str> (15_46) 	<br><blue>18(3)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (10_3) 	<br><blue>19(2)</blue>: <m_str>a moral statement</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (11_17) 	<br><blue>20(2)</blue>: <m_str>these events</m_str> (11_30) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (12_1) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
