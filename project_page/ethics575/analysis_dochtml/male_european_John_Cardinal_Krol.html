<blue>1</blue>John Cardinal Krol , who headed the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia for 27 years and was a pivotal figure in the American church , died early yesterday at his home in Philadelphia . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 85 . <br><blue>3</blue>He was hospitalized on Feb. 14 for fluid in his lungs attributed to diabetes-related kidney problems . <br><blue>4</blue>Doctors sent him home on Saturday , saying he was unlikely to recover . <br><blue>5</blue>The Cardinal , who retired as Archbishop in 1988 , was an outspoken defender of traditional theology , hierarchical authority and strict church discipline . <br><blue>6</blue>Combining those conservative views with managerial skill , he became a prominent figure in American Catholicism in the two decades after the Second Vatican Council , which revised many Catholic practices . <br><blue>7</blue>Appointed Archbishop of Philadelphia by Pope John XXIII in February 1961 , he stood out among American prelates at the Council , held from 1962 to 1965 . <br><blue>8</blue>He served as a permanent under secretary and a member of the central coordinating committee during the Council . <br><blue>9</blue>But after Pope Paul VI elevated him to Cardinal in June 1967 , he soon joined those alarmed by the pressures for change that Vatican II produced . <br><blue>10</blue>In the years after the historic meeting , Cardinal Krol chastised Catholics who questioned church authority . <br><blue>11</blue>He spoke harshly of priests who left the priesthood . <br><blue>12</blue>He referred to the church 's condemnation of contraception , reaffirmed by Pope Paul VI in 1968 , as " divine law . " <br><blue>13</blue>He also opposed many of the small accommodations or options in church discipline that gained favor after Vatican II : looser regulations governing marriages between Catholics and non-Catholics , the reception of Communion in the hand and attending Mass on Saturday evening instead of Sunday . <br><blue>14</blue>Cardinal Krol 's conservatism did not keep him from voicing strong criticism of the nuclear arms race . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1979 , his Congressional testimony backing talks on limiting strategic arms foreshadowed an appeal in a pastoral letter by American bishops for nuclear disarmament in 1983 . <br><blue>16</blue>At the high tide of the nuclear freeze movement in 1982 , Cardinal Krol told 15,000 demonstrators at a Philadelphia rally that it was time for governments " to dismantle existing nuclear weapons . " <br><blue>17</blue>He later acknowledged that his belief in gradual and reciprocal disarmament , with strong safeguards against cheating , was probably not shared by all the demonstrators . <br><blue>18</blue>Always a staunch supporter of the Roman Catholic school system , he defended it against criticism from within and repeatedly sought government aid to relieve what he saw as an unfair financial burden on families that chose to send their children to parochial schools . <br><blue>19</blue>He was publicly identified with the Republican Party , accompanying President Richard M. Nixon to the rostrum when Mr. Nixon pledged to aid private and parochial schools at an April 1972 meeting of Catholic educators . <br><blue>20</blue>In 1984 , Cardinal Krol appeared with President Ronald Reagan at a campaign rally at a Catholic shrine in Pennsylvania , praising Mr. Reagan for trying to win tax credits for parents of children in religious schools . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>15,000 demonstrators</m_str> (16_16) 	<m_str>all the demonstrators</m_str> (17_24) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the church 's</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>the American church</m_str> (1_22) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>the Roman Catholic school system</m_str> (18_6) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Saturday</m_str> (13_41) 	<m_str>Saturday</m_str> (4_6) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Council</m_str> (8_17) 	<m_str>the Council</m_str> (7_20) 	<m_str>the Second Vatican Council , which revised many Catholic practices</m_str> (6_22) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>the priesthood</m_str> (11_8) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Vatican II</m_str> (13_18) 	<m_str>Vatican II</m_str> (9_25) 	<br><blue>8(4)</blue>: <m_str>Philadelphia</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>Philadelphia</m_str> (16_20) 	<m_str>Philadelphia</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>Philadelphia</m_str> (1_12) 	<br><blue>9(27)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Pope Paul VI</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>Cardinal Krol</m_str> (16_13) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_30) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Cardinal Krol</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (4_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_27) 	<m_str>Cardinal Krol</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>Pope Paul VI in 1968</m_str> (12_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_9) 	<m_str>Cardinal Krol 's</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (14_8) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
