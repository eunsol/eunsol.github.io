<blue>1</blue>David M. Kennedy , who was Secretary of the Treasury in the first two years of the Nixon Administration , died Wednesday at his home in Salt Lake City . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 90 , and had long suffered from a heart ailment . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Kennedy , whose career included a succession of Government and business posts , came to prominence as chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company when it was Chicago 's largest bank . <br><blue>4</blue>As chairman , he was credited with reinvigorating it after a long malaise and establishing a strong overseas presence . <br><blue>5</blue>He was chosen by President-elect Richard M. Nixon in late 1968 for the top Treasury job , which he held until resigning in late 1970 under pressure from Mr. Nixon , who was unhappy with the nation 's stagnant economy and rising inflation . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Kennedy was succeeded by John B. Connally , a politically astute former Governor of Texas who had been Secretary of the Navy under President John F. Kennedy . <br><blue>7</blue>An early gaffe committed by David Kennedy even before being sworn in to his Treasury post was his refusal at a news conference to rule out the possibility that the Government might raise the price of gold , then fixed officially at $ 35 an ounce . <br><blue>8</blue>Shortly afterward he caused another stir with a similar comment about imposing wage and price controls to curb inflation . <br><blue>9</blue>On leaving the Treasury , Mr. Kennedy was appointed Ambassador at Large , remaining in the Nixon Cabinet , and the President subsequently named him United States Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Kennedy was the son of a Utah rancher and legislator , working on the ranch in the summer and attending school in nearby Ogden in the winter . <br><blue>11</blue>He frustrated his family 's expectations that he would succeed his grandfather as president of the Bank of Randolph when , as a student at Weber State College in Ogden , he decided on a law career . <br><blue>12</blue>After a two-year mission in Britain for the Mormon Church , Mr. Kennedy came to Washington to work as a technical assistant in the Federal Reserve System . <br><blue>13</blue>He later described this experience -- reopening and liquidating banks -- as having turned his interest to economics and banking , " and I became impressed with the cooperation possible between business and government . " <br><blue>14</blue>He later rose to special assistant to Marriner Eccles , another native of Utah , then chairman of the Federal Reserve Board . <br><blue>15</blue>Mr. Kennedy also received a law degree after attending George Washington University at night . <br><blue>16</blue>In 1946 , passing up an offer from a New York bank that would have paid him six times as much , Mr. Kennedy joined the bond department of Continental Bank . <br><blue>17</blue>By 1955 he was named president , shortly after returning from a 14-month period in which he served as assistant to Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey . <br><blue>18</blue>After leaving the Government , Mr. Kennedy developed a close business relationship with Michele Sindona , the financier who controlled Franklin National Bank in New York , which collapsed in scandal . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Kennedy testified at a 1979 trial of three former Franklin executives that he had introduced Mr. Sindona to bank regulators and officials here and abroad , and had once borrowed $ 200,000 from the financier for a land venture in Arizona . <br><blue>20</blue>Mr. Kennedy held various lay positions with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , including special representative -- a kind of international ambassador -- for the First Presidency , the top governing body of the Mormon Church . <br><hr><br><blue>1(5)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (3_30) 	<m_str>Chicago 's largest bank</m_str> (3_32) 	<m_str>the Continental Illinois National Bank</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (4_9) 	<m_str>Continental Bank</m_str> (16_30) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (16_10) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (18_25) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Utah</m_str> (10_8) 	<m_str>Utah</m_str> (14_14) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Government</m_str> (7_30) 	<m_str>the Government</m_str> (18_3) 	<br><blue>5(5)</blue>: <m_str>Treasury</m_str> (5_15) 	<m_str>Treasury</m_str> (7_15) 	<m_str>Treasury</m_str> (17_22) 	<m_str>the Treasury in the first two years</m_str> (1_9) 	<m_str>the Treasury</m_str> (9_3) 	<br><blue>6(34)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Kennedy</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>President John F.
