<blue>1</blue>Dr. John Tuzo Wilson , a geophysicist who was one of the most persuasive proponents of the theory that the continents are on rigid plates that slowly drift around the earth 's surface , died in Toronto on April 15 . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 84 . <br><blue>3</blue>His death was reported in the current issue of Eos , a publication of the American Geophysical Union . <br><blue>4</blue>The cause of death appears to have been a heart attack , said Prof. Ron Farquhar , his associate and former student at the University of Toronto . <br><blue>5</blue>Dr. Wilson , who known to many of his colleagues as Tuzo , was an emeritus professor in the university 's physics department . <br><blue>6</blue>He became an eloquent proponent of the drift hypothesis , now known as plate tectonics . <br><blue>7</blue>In the 1960 's , having been taught the conventional view that continents remain fixed relative to one another , he was won over by variety of new observations . <br><blue>8</blue>In 1966 , he published a paper , " Did the Atlantic Close and Then Reopen ? " <br><blue>9</blue>in the journal Nature , pointing out that ancient fossils along the coasts of New England and Canada were European , rather than American . <br><blue>10</blue>Yet fossils of similar age from coastal Norway and Scotland were American . <br><blue>11</blue>The explanation , he said , was that the Atlantic had closed , then reopened , leaving part of Europe stuck to America and a sliver of America stuck to Europe . <br><blue>12</blue>It has since been concluded that such openings and closings have occurred more than once , and they are known as Wilson cycles . <br><blue>13</blue>John Tuzo Wilson was born in Ottawa on Oct. 24 , 1908 , and during his high school years spent his summers assisting various geologists working in the Canadian Arctic and other parts of Canada and Montana . <br><blue>14</blue>After graduating from the University of Toronto in 1930 , he won a two-year scholarship at Cambridge University , which later was to pioneer in development of the plate theory . <br><blue>15</blue>Service in World War II In 1936 he obtained his doctorate at Princeton University and then , for three years , served with the Geological Survey of Canada . <br><blue>16</blue>In World War II he joined the Canadian Army and , in 1944 , directed an Arctic training program . <br><blue>17</blue>After the war he returned to the University of Toronto as professor of geophysics and in 1967 became principal of Erindale College there . <br><blue>18</blue>In 1957-58 he was a leader in the International Geophysical Year , an ambitious program of cooperative global research . <br><blue>19</blue>After China had refused to join in the International Geophysical Year , in protest of Taiwan 's inclusion , he visited China , playing a major role in promoting scientific exchanges between China and Canada . <br><blue>20</blue>His book , " One Chinese Moon , " told of his visit there . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Toronto</m_str> (1_37) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>China</m_str> (19_33) 	<m_str>China</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>China</m_str> (19_22) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>the American Geophysical Union</m_str> (3_15) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the International Geophysical Year , an ambitious program of cooperative global research</m_str> (18_8) 	<m_str>the International Geophysical Year</m_str> (19_8) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>Canada</m_str> (9_18) 	<m_str>Canada</m_str> (15_28) 	<m_str>Canada</m_str> (19_35) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>a sliver of America</m_str> (11_25) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>such openings</m_str> (12_7) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (12_18) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>World War II</m_str> (15_3) 	<m_str>World War II</m_str> (16_2) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>the University of Toronto</m_str> (4_24) 	<m_str>the university 's</m_str> (5_19) 	<m_str>the University of Toronto</m_str> (14_4) 	<br><blue>10(9)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_18) 	<m_str>Dr. Wilson , who known to many of his colleagues as Tuzo</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_4) 	<br><blue>11(13)</blue>: <m_str>Wilson</m_str> (12_22) 	<m_str>John Tuzo Wilson</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_12) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (20_1) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
