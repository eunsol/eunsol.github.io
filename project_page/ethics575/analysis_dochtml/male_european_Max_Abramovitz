<blue>1</blue>Max Abramovitz , the architect who designed Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center and also had a hand in the building of the United Nations complex and several well-known Midtown skyscrapers , died on Sunday at his home in Pound Ridge , N.Y . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 96 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Abramovitz was born in Chicago and received his early training there , but it was in New York City , in a long partnership with Wallace K. Harrison , that he made a significant contribution to postwar modernist architecture . <br><blue>4</blue>Though he worked on a huge array of projects in his career , from embassies to college campuses to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley , Va. , the Philharmonic Hall , later renamed Avery Fisher Hall , has remained the most prominent and emblematic of Mr. Abramovitz 's designs . <br><blue>5</blue>At the time it opened in 1962 , the first of Lincoln Center 's five buildings to be completed , its tapered neo-Classical-style columns and glass-walled interior were praised by Ada Louise Huxtable in The New York Times as '' impressive and handsome , '' especially in the way they worked at night as the hall filled with concertgoers . '' <br><blue>6</blue>From the outside , the drama of light , movement and color , seen through the glass walls , enclosed by the great tapered frame , makes the structure a spectacular success in action , '' she wrote . <br><blue>7</blue>But the building later became a lightning rod for criticism , in part because its acoustics were almost immediately found to be lacking by members of the Philharmonic , who described it variously as a '' pinball machine , '' a '' television studio '' and '' raw alcohol instead of a vintage wine . '' <br><blue>8</blue>The verdict of many other architecture critics has also not been as kind as that of Ms. Huxtable . <br><blue>9</blue>Paul Goldberger , appraising the Lincoln Center complex for The Times in 1979 , called the major buildings '' prissy and overdelicate both inside and out , with a heavy-handedness of form and vulgarity of detail that looked poor in the 1960 's and look no less so now . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Abramovitz died just as the first major retrospective of his work was preparing to open at the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University , where his papers are housed . <br><blue>11</blue>In an in-depth scholarly appraisal of Mr. Abramovitz 's career , John Harwood , a Columbia doctoral candidate , calls his design of Avery Fisher Hall probably his most triumphant moment but in the end a Pyrrhic victory . <br><blue>12</blue>The essay also points out that Mr. Abramovitz 's work has remained largely unstudied in part because he did not develop a signature style and he did not cut the kind of larger-than-life figure that many of his architectural contemporaries did . <br><blue>13</blue>For much of his career , he worked in the shadow of Mr. Harrison , his powerful , well-connected partner , who was close to the Rockefeller family and became a kind of master planner of the city 's complexes , overseeing the design of Rockefeller Center , the United Nations and Lincoln Center . <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Abramovitz , the son of working-class Romanian immigrants , met Mr. Harris for the first time in 1931 and joined his firm as an associate in 1935 . <br><blue>15</blue>He quickly became a partner , and over the next three decades , the two men collaborated on a number of well-known Manhattan skyscrapers , including the Mobil Building at 150 East 42d Street , the Corning Glass building at 717 Fifth Avenue and the Time &amp; Life , McGraw-Hill , Exxon and Celanese Buildings on the Avenue of the Americas . <br><blue>16</blue>He was also the deputy director of planning for the United Nations complex and later served as the master planner for Brandeis University , in addition to designing United States embassies in Havana and Rio de Janeiro . <br><blue>17</blue>During World War II he built air fields in China for Gen. Claire L. Chennault 's Flying Tigers and received the Legion of Merit . <br><blue>18</blue>Though he was known as an extreme workaholic , he did have a family . <br><blue>19</blue>He is survived by his son , Michael , of Denver ; his daughter , Katherine , of Alexandria , Va. ; and five grandchildren . <br><blue>20</blue>He also collected art and sculpture , which he described as his only hobbies .
