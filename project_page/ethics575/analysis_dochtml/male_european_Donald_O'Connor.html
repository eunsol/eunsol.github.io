<blue>1</blue>Donald Joseph O'Connor , a civil engineer and a leading authority on water pollution and sanitary engineering , died on Friday at his home in Glen Rock , N.J . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 74 . <br><blue>3</blue>He died of cancer , said a spokeswoman for Manhattan College in Riverdale , the Bronx , where he was distinguished professor emeritus in environmental engineering and science . <br><blue>4</blue>He joined the faculty in 1952 and worked at the college until a few months ago . <br><blue>5</blue>Dr. O'Connor had an international reputation for his work in water quality analysis and played an important role in a study of the New York-New Jersey Harbor . <br><blue>6</blue>His research on estuary analysis provided a framework in the 1960 's for a model on which to base later studies of the harbor . <br><blue>7</blue>It has since been widened to encompass Long Island Sound , the New York Bight and the Hudson River . <br><blue>8</blue>He was a founder in 1959 of Hydroscience , one of the earliest consulting firms to combine wastewater treatment planning with the analysis of water-quality conditions . <br><blue>9</blue>The New York Harbor study was its first big job , followed by an even bigger contract involving water-quality models for the Great Lakes . <br><blue>10</blue>The firm also did work for water quality and resource planning for the Great Lakes Basin . <br><blue>11</blue>Hydroscience was reorganized in 1976 as Hydroqual of Mahwah , N.J. , for which Dr. O'Connor was a consultant . <br><blue>12</blue>He was born in Brooklyn and received an engineering degree from Manhattan College . <br><blue>13</blue>After combat service in the Army during World War II that included the Battle of the Bulge , he graduated from Polytechic Institute of Brooklyn in 1947 and got a doctorate in engineering at New York University in 1956 . <br><blue>14</blue>He worked for some engineering firms before joining the Manhattan faculty . <br><blue>15</blue>At the college , he developed a formula for calculating the exchange of oxygen into streams and rivers that provided a mathematical model for explaining the process . <br><blue>16</blue>He taught classes in surveying and hydraulics and helped develop the college 's graduate program in environmental engineering , with courses in mathematical models and the analysis of natural water systems . <br><blue>17</blue>He lectured widely in the United States and abroad and published more than 100 technical papers and a textbook on biological waste treatment , which was translated into 11 languages . <br><blue>18</blue>Manhattan established an O'Connor Endowed Chair in his honor in 1994 . <br><blue>19</blue>He was a four-time winner of the Rudolf Hering Medal , which the American Society of Civil Engineers awards annually for the outstanding contribution in environmental engineering . <br><blue>20</blue>Dr. O'Connor is survived by his wife of 48 years , Anita Lordi O'Connor ; a son , Dennis , of Fairfax , Va. ; two daughters , Arlene O'Connor-Bell of Upper Saddle River , N.J. , and Jeanette O'Connor of Wellesley , Mass. ; his brother , the Rev.
