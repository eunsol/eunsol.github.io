<blue>1</blue>Ben Hogan , the flinty-eyed Texan who was perhaps the most creative shotmaker in the history of golf and one of its most accomplished players , died yesterday morning in Fort Worth . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 84 . <br><blue>3</blue>He had been in poor health since undergoing surgery for colon cancer two years ago , then contracting bronchitis soon afterward , according to Valerie Hogan , his wife of 62 years . <br><blue>4</blue>She said he entered All Saints Hospital in Fort Worth on Thursday morning after suffering a fall at home . <br><blue>5</blue>Byron Nelson , another golfing legend who was a longtime friend , said Hogan had a stroke . <br><blue>6</blue>Although he was a very private man who preferred in recent years to remain close to his home in West over Hills , Tex. , and his office at Shady Oaks Country Club , Hogan 's influence on the game nonetheless was profound and his legacy far-reaching . <br><blue>7</blue>When he was at the peak of his powers , winning nine major championships -- four United States Opens , two Masters , two P.G.A. championships and one British Open -- from 1946 to 1953 , he was considered by many to be the finest player in the game . <br><blue>8</blue>He is one of only four players to win all four major professional championships , and his 63 career victories rank third behind Sam Snead ( 81 ) and Jack Nicklaus ( 70 ) . <br><blue>9</blue>In 1953 , probably the greatest year any professional golfer has had , he won the Masters , the United States Open and the British Open , the first three legs of the modern Grand Slam , a feat no other player has accomplished . <br><blue>10</blue>His indelible mark on the game stemmed not merely from his ability to control a golf ball , perhaps with more precision than anyone before or since , but also from his enormous will -- a determination that forced him to remake his entire golf game , to come back from a near-fatal automobile accident and to set standards of excellence that were previously only imagined . '' <br><blue>11</blue>What set Ben apart from everybody else was his inside game -- the unbelievable will to win , the quiet determination , the intense concentration , '' Hogan 's old friend , the golfer Jimmy Demaret , once said . <br><blue>12</blue>It was that steely sense of purpose and the impeccable technique he developed throughout his career that engendered legions of admirers , many of whom never saw him play . <br><blue>13</blue>His legendary work ethic and quiet demeanor , combined with an aversion to interviews and public appearances , created what was known as the Hogan mystique , an aura that impressed even the most callous observers . '' <br><blue>14</blue>All I know is I 've seen Jack Nicklaus watch Hogan practice , '' the great Texas golfer Tommy Bolt once said . '' <br><blue>15</blue>I 've never seen Hogan watch Nicklaus practice . '' <br><blue>16</blue>Hogan was a taciturn man whose conservative and spare attire -- he wore only tans , grays , whites and navy blues topped off by a white cap -- reflected his exacting personality . <br><blue>17</blue>He earned the nickname Bantam Ben because at 5 feet 8 inches he was short but aggressive , like a bantam . <br><blue>18</blue>He was also known as the Wee Ice Mon for his steely-eyed approach to the game . <br><blue>19</blue>But mostly he was called , simply , Hogan . <br><blue>20</blue>Although his life and game will always be remembered as straightforward and indomitable , Hogan nonetheless had a flair for the dramatic on the golf course . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>his life</m_str> (20_2) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Jack Nicklaus</m_str> (8_30) 	<m_str>Jack Nicklaus</m_str> (14_8) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Fort Worth</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>Fort Worth</m_str> (4_9) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (15_1) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Masters</m_str> (7_22) 	<m_str>the Masters</m_str> (9_16) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the British Open</m_str> (9_24) 	<m_str>the United States Open</m_str> (9_19) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>his career</m_str> (12_15) 	<br><blue>8(42)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_28) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_3) 	<m_str>Hogan</m_str> (5_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_27) 	<m_str>Hogan 's</m_str> (6_35) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_45) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_37) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_14) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_32) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (10_40) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_43) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>Hogan 's</m_str> (11_28) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_15) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (12_28) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>Hogan</m_str> (13_25) 	<m_str>Hogan</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>Hogan</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>Hogan watch Nicklaus</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>Hogan</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_31) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>Hogan</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>Hogan</m_str> (20_15) 	<br><blue>9(5)</blue>: <m_str>the game</m_str> (6_39) 	<m_str>the game</m_str> (7_48) 	<m_str>the game</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>his entire golf game</m_str> (10_43) 	<m_str>his inside game</m_str> (11_9) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
