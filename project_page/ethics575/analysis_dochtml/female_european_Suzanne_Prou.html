" <br><blue>8</blue>And the New Yorker said that she made " the charged atmosphere of decaying provincial life as fascinating as a drop of pond water viewed through the lens of a microscope . " <br><blue>9</blue>Her first novel , " Les Patapharis , " which appeared in France in 1966 and was later published in English as " The Patapharis Affair , " won the Prix Femina and was praised by Martin Levin in The New York Times Book Review as a " delicately shadowed work of art . " <br><blue>10</blue>Her last book , " L'Album de Famille , " came out last year . <br><blue>11</blue>Mrs. Prou embraced a variety of causes during her life . <br><blue>12</blue>During the German occupation of France she took a stand against anti-Semitism , helping to produce an underground newspaper that denounced it . <br><blue>13</blue>She was subsequently made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor . <br><blue>14</blue>Over the years , she was also an ardent feminist and supporter of human rights . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1994 , in a long program about AIDS that was broadcast on all French television channels , she gave a harrowing account of how her 26-year-old granddaughter , Erica , had died of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome the previous year . <br><blue>16</blue>The novelist was born Suzanne Doreau , the daughter of an army officer and a teacher , in a village near St.-Tropez on the French Riviera . <br><blue>17</blue>She grew up partly in Algeria and Indochina , pursued university studies in France -- in Marseilles and Aix-en-Provence -- received a degree in literature in 1942 and was a schoolteacher for a time . <br><blue>18</blue>Her husband , Charles Prou , died earlier . <br><blue>19</blue>They married in 1944 and had a daughter , Anne-Francoise . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>France</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>France</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>France</m_str> (17_14) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (12_22) 	<m_str>a stand against anti-Semitism</m_str> (12_9) 	<br><blue>3(8)</blue>: <m_str>she</m_str> (1_18) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (8_7) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>that book</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>Her last book</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>5(11)</blue>: <m_str>Mrs. Prou -LRB- pronounced proo -RRB-</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Madame Prou</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>Mrs. Prou</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_7) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_19) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_26) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (18_1) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>a novelist of bittersweet nostalgia</m_str> (3_18) 	<m_str>The novelist</m_str> (16_1) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
