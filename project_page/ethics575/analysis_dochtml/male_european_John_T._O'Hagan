<blue>1</blue>John T. O'Hagan , who served simultaneously as chief of the New York City Fire Department and as Fire Commissioner in the mid-70 's , died yesterday at his home in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 65 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>He died of cardiopulmonary arrest because of widespread cancer , which he had been fighting since July 1989 , said his son , Michael . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. O'Hagan , who fostered many innovations during his leadership of the department , including the creation of a strong fire-safety law for high-rise buildings and the use of " cherry picker " tower ladders , was 39 years old when he was appointed chief of the department in 1964 , the youngest chief in the department 's history . <br><blue>5</blue>In addition , he was appointed Fire Commissioner in 1973 by Mayor John V. Lindsay and retained both posts under Mayor Abraham D. Beame . <br><blue>6</blue>" He was one of New York City 's best-known fire officials , and respected worldwide as an expert on high-rise fire , " said John Mulligan , a former deputy fire commissioner for public information and now a spokesman for the Uniformed Firefighters Association . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Mulligan said Mr. O'Hagan was considered the author of Local Law 5 , which was regarded as the most stringent high-rise fire-safety law in the nation when it passed in 1973 , following fires in two nearly completed office towers that killed 5 people and injured 69 . <br><blue>8</blue>First Female Applicants The law required a fire alarm and communication system for buildings higher than 100 feet , another system that automatically recalled elevators to the ground floor in a fire and a sprinkler system for most centrally air-conditioned buildings . <br><blue>9</blue>In the early 1970 's , Mr. O'Hagan ordered the use of " cherry picker " tower ladders that could reach above the seventh floor , remove people from windows and spray large amounts of water . <br><blue>10</blue>Also during his tenure , the first female applicants took Fire Department tests . <br><blue>11</blue>Despite resistance among many firemen to the idea of female firefighters , Commissioner O'Hagan said he saw " no physical or mental impediment to a woman being a firefighter . " <br><blue>12</blue>He instituted annual medical exams for firefighters , fire-retardant work uniforms , a newsletter , commendation bars similar to military medals and a contest to design the Fire Department 's shoulder patch . <br><blue>13</blue>When Mayor Edward I Koch did not reappoint him commissioner in 1978 , he left the department and started a fire safety consulting business . <br><blue>14</blue>Evaluated Departments John T. O'Hagan Associates evaluated fire departments in cities like Los Angeles , Minneapolis and Dallas . <br><blue>15</blue>Mr. O'Hagan was born on April 7 , 1925 , in New York City . <br><blue>16</blue>During World War II he was a platoon sergeant who saw action with the 11th Airborne Division in the South Pacific . <br><blue>17</blue>He was appointed to the Fire Department in 1947 and received six meritorious commendations and a medal for administration . <br><blue>18</blue>Survivors in addition to his son , who lives in Manhattan , are his wife , Catherine ; two daughters , Catherine Wolfe of North Tarrytown , N.Y. , and Susan Marley of Montclair , N.J. ; his mother , Mary Wallace O'Hagan of Brooklyn , and two grandchildren . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the first female applicants</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>First Female Applicants</m_str> (8_1) 	<br><blue>2(27)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Hagan</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>his son , Michael</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>Commissioner O'Hagan</m_str> (11_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_38) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_4) 	<m_str>Mary Wallace O'Hagan of Brooklyn</m_str> (18_41) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Hagan</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Fire Commissioner in the mid-70 's</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_42) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Departments John T.
