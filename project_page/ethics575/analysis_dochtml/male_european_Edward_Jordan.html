<blue>1</blue>Edward G. Jordan , who helped to lift the remnants of several railroad freight lines out of bankruptcy as the first chairman and chief executive of Conrail , died on Wednesday at his vacation home in Bend , Ore . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 72 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Jordan , who also had a home in the San Francisco area , had suffered from esophageal cancer , his family said . <br><blue>4</blue>A native of Oakland , Calif. , Mr. Jordan graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1951 and earned a master 's in business administration from Stanford University . <br><blue>5</blue>He worked for several corporations , including the Ford Motor Company and Procter &amp; Gamble . <br><blue>6</blue>He was a Los Angeles insurance executive when President Gerald R. Ford selected him in 1974 to be president of the United States Railway Association , the federal agency formed to develop a plan to take over most properties of ailing freight carriers in the Northeast and the Midwest . <br><blue>7</blue>After he had been president of the association for 17 months , its board picked him in mid-1975 to head the new line created by the association : the Consolidated Rail Corporation , known as Conrail . <br><blue>8</blue>Although he had no experience with railroads , Mr. Jordan was confident he could do what earlier train executives could not . <br><blue>9</blue>His credo was , the fewer managers , the better . '' <br><blue>10</blue>One of the real problems with American industry , in large organizations such as the railroads , '' he said at the time , '' is that you get such incredible depth in management that the nature of a real problem and the man dealing with it never gets to the decision maker . '' <br><blue>11</blue>But Mr. Jordan was battling more than management problems , however intractable they may have been ; he was also up against the tide of history . <br><blue>12</blue>For much of the 19th century , there were scores of thriving railroad freight lines . <br><blue>13</blue>But by the middle of the 20th century , there were only six : the Penn Central , the Central Railroad of New Jersey , the Erie Lackawanna , the Lehigh and Hudson River , the Lehigh Valley and the Reading . <br><blue>14</blue>Buffeted by competition from trucks using the Interstate highway system , hobbled by federal requirements to run money-losing passenger service , the six railroads deferred maintenance on trains and tracks . <br><blue>15</blue>As their service deteriorated , more freight business went to the trucks in what seemed to be a death spiral for the rail lines . <br><blue>16</blue>One by one , the six lines entered bankruptcy in the early 1970 's , weakening a national economy already in recession . <br><blue>17</blue>The federal government responded by creating Conrail and appropriating money to rebuild tracks , locomotives and freight cars . <br><blue>18</blue>Congress also loosened some regulations , making it easier for trains to compete with trucks , and created Amtrak to take over intercity passenger service from the freight railroads . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Jordan confidently predicted a quick turnaround , with engines in mint condition hauling more freight for more customers on smoother tracks . <br><blue>20</blue>But despite his efforts to modernize the operation and bring costs under control , Conrail ran at a loss and was troubled by problems and complaints for many months . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the rail lines</m_str> (15_22) 	<m_str>the six lines</m_str> (16_5) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Calif.</m_str> (4_6) 	<br><blue>3(14)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>his family</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>Mr. Jordan , who also had a home in the San Francisco area</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (7_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_19) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>a real problem</m_str> (10_39) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (10_47) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>The federal government</m_str> (17_1) 	<br><blue>6(4)</blue>: <m_str>Conrail</m_str> (1_27) 	<m_str>Conrail</m_str> (7_36) 	<m_str>Conrail</m_str> (17_7) 	<m_str>Conrail</m_str> (20_15) 	<br><blue>7(6)</blue>: <m_str>Oakland , Calif. , Mr. Jordan</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Jordan</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Jordan</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Jordan</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_3) 	<br><blue>8(4)</blue>: <m_str>the United States Railway Association</m_str> (6_21) 	<m_str>the association</m_str> (7_26) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>the association for 17 months</m_str> (7_7) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>the six railroads</m_str> (14_22) 	<m_str>the freight railroads</m_str> (18_27) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>Congress</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (18_8) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
