<blue>1</blue>Ardis Krainik , who in 15 years as general director rescued the Lyric Opera of Chicago from financial peril and established it as a company renowned for its forward-looking programming , died on Saturday at her home in Chicago . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 67 . <br><blue>3</blue>Ms. Krainik , who had been ill in recent years , announced last June that she would retire in April . <br><blue>4</blue>But when her health took a turn for the worse in November , her successor , William Mason , took over as director . <br><blue>5</blue>Ms. Krainik was an imposing figure who knew what she wanted for her company and how to get it through inspiration rather than force , although she was not averse to making bold decisions . <br><blue>6</blue>She made international headlines in 1989 , for example , when she announced that Luciano Pavarotti was no longer welcome at the company after he dropped out of a '' Tosca '' production on three weeks ' notice . <br><blue>7</blue>Pointing out that Mr. Pavarotti had bowed out of 26 of his last 41 scheduled appearances at the Lyric , Ms. Krainik said she was afraid Mr. Pavarotti 's unreliability would offend subscribers . <br><blue>8</blue>In a way , Ms. Krainik was the personification of the Lyric Opera . <br><blue>9</blue>She joined the company as a secretary to its founder , Carol Fox , during its first season , and she spent her entire career there . <br><blue>10</blue>There was little in the company 's operation with which she did not have firsthand experience . <br><blue>11</blue>A mezzo-soprano who had performing aspirations early on , she sang small roles during her first five years at the company but gave up the stage in 1960 when she was appointed assistant manager . <br><blue>12</blue>In that job , and later as artistic administrator , she had a hand in everything from pitching in to solve production problems to negotiating artist fees and helping plan seasons . <br><blue>13</blue>When Fox resigned in 1981 , Ms. Krainik was her logical successor . <br><blue>14</blue>When she took over the company , it was on the brink of financial collapse . <br><blue>15</blue>Its endowment had shriveled to $ 6,000 from nearly $ 3 million , and cost overruns on an adventurous production of Krzysztof Penderecki 's '' Paradise Lost '' in 1978 and on the elaborate 25th-anniversary celebration in 1979 , left the Lyric Opera with a $ 1.2 million deficit . <br><blue>16</blue>Ms. Krainik 's first task was to restructure the company 's operations , cutting $ 500,000 from its budget in the process . '' <br><blue>17</blue>One of the things I did was say no , which had not been done enough in the past , '' Ms. Krainik said in a 1982 interview . '' <br><blue>18</blue>We gave up space in our building , allowed attrition to run its course , cut back on orchestra rehearsals and did away with all nonessentials . <br><blue>19</blue>We began to recycle products and borrow stage sets instead of designing all our own . '' <br><blue>20</blue>She restored the company 's fortunes quickly , and by 1993 she had raised much of the money required for a $ 100 million project to purchase and restore the company 's home , the Civic Opera House . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>its first season</m_str> (9_16) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Lyric Opera</m_str> (8_11) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (1_22) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (1_28) 	<m_str>the Lyric Opera of Chicago</m_str> (1_12) 	<br><blue>4(31)</blue>: <m_str>Ardis Krainik , who in 15 years as general director rescued the Lyric Opera of Chicago from financial peril and established it as a company renowned for its forward-looking programming</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Krainik , who had been ill in recent years</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (3_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>Ms. Krainik</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_10) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_27) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>Ms. Krainik</m_str> (7_21) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_24) 	<m_str>Ms. Krainik</m_str> (8_5) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_21) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_23) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_15) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_30) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>Ms. Krainik</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>Ms. Krainik 's</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Krainik</m_str> (17_22) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_12) 	<br><blue>5(5)</blue>: <m_str>Luciano Pavarotti</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Pavarotti 's</m_str> (7_27) 	<m_str>Mr. Pavarotti</m_str> (7_4) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Lyric</m_str> (7_18) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>a $ 100 million project to purchase and restore the company 's home , the Civic Opera House</m_str> (20_21) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>Fox</m_str> (13_2) 	<br><blue>9(15)</blue>: <m_str>her company</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (5_19) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>the company</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>the company 's</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>the company</m_str> (11_20) 	<m_str>the company</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>Its</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (16_18) 	<m_str>the company 's</m_str> (16_9) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (18_13) 	<m_str>the company 's</m_str> (20_30) 	<m_str>the company 's</m_str> (20_3) 	<br><blue>10(4)</blue>: <m_str>We</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>our</m_str> (18_6) 	<m_str>our</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>We</m_str> (19_1) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
