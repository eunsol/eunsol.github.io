<blue>1</blue>James L. Usry , who in 1984 became the first black man to be elected Atlantic City 's mayor but was defeated six years later in the middle of a municipal corruption scandal , died Friday at a nursing home in Galloway Township , N.J . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 79 and had been suffering from diabetes and cancer . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Usry , a Republican who was a middle school teacher , principal and assistant schools superintendent , first ran for public office in 1982 , when he narrowly lost the mayoral election to Michael J. Matthews . <br><blue>4</blue>But two years later Mr. Usry succeeded Mr. Matthews , who was under indictment for bribery and recalled from office . <br><blue>5</blue>In 1990 , Mr. Usry was indicted on charges of conspiracy , official misconduct and bribery -- one of 15 people accused by the state of taking part in an influence-peddling ring . <br><blue>6</blue>Voters turned him out of office that year , even as most of the government 's case against him appeared to collapse . <br><blue>7</blue>He eventually pleaded guilty to a campaign finance law violation and was sentenced to 60 hours ' community service working for the Salvation Army . <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Usry said he was on painkillers after a shoulder operation when a local businessman gave him an envelope containing $ 6,000 , and that the money he received was to be used for a children 's charity . <br><blue>9</blue>James Leroy Usry was born in Athens , Ga. , on Feb. 2 , 1922 , and moved with his family to Atlantic City as a toddler , at a time when jobs for blacks in the deeply segregated resort city were ample but usually menial . <br><blue>10</blue>The racial divisions that kept the black resort workers to their own part of the city , and even their own section of beach , deepened and festered as the city 's fortunes declined in the 1950 's . <br><blue>11</blue>Municipal corruption also seemed , through a stretch beginning in the 1960 's , to have become endemic . <br><blue>12</blue>Three of the five mayors before Mr. Usry were indicted and were either convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes ranging from campaign law violations to bribery . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Usry 's election to City Hall appeared to many people to presage a change in that pattern , because he seemed to have risen above Atlantic City 's many problems and disadvantages . <br><blue>14</blue>A soldier in World War II , he served in Africa and Italy with the 92nd Infantry Division , part of a famous segregated unit called the Black Buffaloes . <br><blue>15</blue>He also worked his way up through Atlantic City 's hospitality industry to become maître d'hôtel at the Club Harlem on Kentucky Avenue in the 1940 's , and also played professional basketball for a time for the Harlem Globetrotters and the New York Renaissance . <br><blue>16</blue>A graduate of Atlantic City High School , Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and Glassboro State College ( now Rowan University ) , Mr. Usry devoted most of his career to education , as a teacher and school administrator , and was widely praised for his involvement with his students and with the community . <br><blue>17</blue>He was 60 when he finally decided to run for city office . <br><blue>18</blue>In 1984 , Gov. Thomas H. Kean said that Mr. Usry 's campaign represented a vivid example of the '' politics of inclusion , '' a trend that Mr. Kean said he hoped would sweep through New Jersey 's cities , eroding racial and economic divisions . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Usry returned the praise , calling himself a '' Kean Republican '' who supported the governor 's efforts to broaden racial and ethnic participation in state government . <br><blue>20</blue>But Atlantic City 's wounds did not heal . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_28) 	<br><blue>2(10)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (16_48) 	<m_str>Mr. Kean</m_str> (18_29) 	<m_str>A graduate of Atlantic City High School , Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and Glassboro State College -LRB- now Rowan University -RRB- , Mr. Usry</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_32) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>Gov.
