<blue>1</blue>Danilo Dolci , an advocate of nonviolent social reform whose writings and poetry chronicled Sicily 's beauty and sense of despair , died today in a hospital in Sicily of heart failure . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 73 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Dolci , who suffered from diabetes and was debilitated recently by pneumonia after a visit to China , had used a wheelchair in recent months . <br><blue>4</blue>A labor organizer , Mr. Dolci lived and worked in rural western Sicily for more than four decades , employing nonviolent methods to campaign for jobs and the transfer of water rights from the Mafia to farmers ' collectives that twice earned him nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize , in 1965 and 1982 . <br><blue>5</blue>The Western news media made a romantic figure of Mr. Dolci , calling him the Sicilian Gandhi , and scholars and writers from many countries flocked to the small research center he set up in the village of Partinico , near Palermo , to learn from his methods . <br><blue>6</blue>A prolific writer of prose and poetry , he has also been called by literary critics the Studs Terkel of Sicily , although Mr. Dolci was the first of the two to chronicle the lives of workers . <br><blue>7</blue>The most striking of his many books include collections of interviews with Sicilian peasants , fishermen , priests and street cleaners that document not only the beauty but also the heartbreak of their lives . <br><blue>8</blue>Though not a member of a political party , Mr. Dolci was a darling of the European left . <br><blue>9</blue>The president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies , Luciano Violante , a leader of the Democratic Party of the Left , a formerly Communist group , praised him today for his '' courageous passion , and deep sense of social justice . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Born near Trieste of a Sicilian father and Slovenian mother , Mr. Dolci studied architecture in Switzerland before going to live in Sicily in 1952 , when he was 28 . <br><blue>11</blue>At first limiting his activities to the fishing village of Trappeto , where he lived with his father , a railway stationmaster , he borrowed from Gandhi the technique of fasting as a political weapon and developed other unorthodox tactics . <br><blue>12</blue>One of these was the '' strike in reverse , '' which consisted of launching unauthorized public works projects for the poor and unemployed . <br><blue>13</blue>Struggling against local racketeers and the Mafia , Mr. Dolci taught school , organized farmers ' and craftsmen 's cooperatives , and agitated for bridges and dams to aid transport and irrigate the land . <br><blue>14</blue>It remained something of mystery why Mr. Dolci was left in relative tranquillity by the Mafia , with his supporters suggesting that the Mafia feared a backlash if any harm befell such a popular figure . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1958 , after he dispatched 150 unemployed men to repair a dirt road outside Partinico , he was arrested , convicted on trumped-up charges and sentenced to eight months in jail . <br><blue>16</blue>A year earlier , Moscow had awarded him the $ 30,000 Lenin Peace Prize . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Dolci accepted , but in a characteristic statement of independence affirmed he was not a Communist but would accept money from whatever source . <br><blue>18</blue>In 1967 , long before the decisive rending of the links between Sicilian politics and the Mafia in the 1990 's , Mr. Dolci began attacking leaders of the governing Christian Democratic Party by name , accusing them of collusion with organized crime . <br><blue>19</blue>He was convicted of libel and sentenced to two years in jail . <br><blue>20</blue>About that time Mr. Dolci began broadcasting his social creed over a private radio station , thus violating the Government 's monopoly of the airwaves . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>Sicilian</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>Sicilian</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>Sicilian</m_str> (18_13) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Palermo</m_str> (5_42) 	<br><blue>3(4)</blue>: <m_str>Sicily 's</m_str> (1_15) 	<m_str>Sicily</m_str> (10_23) 	<m_str>Sicily</m_str> (6_21) 	<m_str>Sicily</m_str> (1_29) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>trumped-up charges</m_str> (15_24) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>a Sicilian father</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>his father , a railway stationmaster</m_str> (11_17) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (18_38) 	<m_str>attacking leaders of the governing Christian</m_str> (18_26) 	<br><blue>7(30)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (14_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_47) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_28) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Dolci</m_str> (18_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Dolci</m_str> (8_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Dolci</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Dolci</m_str> (5_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (5_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Dolci accepted , but in a characteristic statement of independence</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Dolci</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_13) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (4_43) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_32) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (9_29) 	<m_str>Mr. Dolci</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Dolci</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_32) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Dolci</m_str> (6_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_4) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>a private radio station</m_str> (20_12) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Partinico</m_str> (5_39) 	<m_str>Partinico</m_str> (15_16) 	<br><blue>10(5)</blue>: <m_str>the Mafia in the 1990 's , Mr. Dolci</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>the Mafia</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>the Mafia</m_str> (14_23) 	<m_str>the Mafia</m_str> (4_34) 	<m_str>the Mafia</m_str> (14_15) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
