<blue>1</blue>Isang Yun , a Korean-born German composer of powerful , kaleidoscopically scored chamber and orchestral works , died on Friday in Berlin , where he lived . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 78 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was a lung infection , according to The Associated Press . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Yun , who was admired among musicians for the inventiveness with which he combined Western and traditional Korean and Chinese musical techniques , became known outside musical circles in June 1967 , when South Korean agents abducted him and his wife , Soo Ya Yun , from their West Berlin apartment . <br><blue>5</blue>Because he had visited North Korea four years earlier , Mr. Yun was tried for treason and sentenced to life in prison . <br><blue>6</blue>His wife was sentenced to three years as an accomplice . <br><blue>7</blue>International pressure on South Korea -- including a formal protest by the West German Government and a petition from a large group of Western composers and performers , led by Igor Stravinsky -- led to the Yuns ' release two years later . <br><blue>8</blue>They returned to West Germany and became citizens in 1971 . <br><blue>9</blue>A second kidnapping attempt in 1976 , during a visit to Japan , was thwarted by the composer 's bodyguards . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Yun was born in Tongyong , in what is now South Korea , on Sept. 17 , 1917 . <br><blue>11</blue>He began composing when he was 14 and in the early 1940 's went to Japan to study in Tokyo and at the Osaka Conservatory . <br><blue>12</blue>But he opposed the Japanese occupation of Korea , and upon his return to Korea he joined an underground group , an act for which he was imprisoned by the occupation authorities . <br><blue>13</blue>After World War II , he became a music teacher in Tongyong and later at Seoul University . <br><blue>14</blue>His early compositions were performed and published ( although he subsequently withdrew these ) , and in 1955 he won the Seoul City Award , which made it possible for him to pursue further studies at the Paris Conservatory , the Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin , and at Darmstadt . <br><blue>15</blue>He remained in Germany , settling in West Berlin in 1964 . <br><blue>16</blue>In the music he composed during these years -- " Loyang " ( 1962 ) and " Reak " ( 1966 ) , for orchestra ; " Gasa " for violin and piano ( 1963 ) , and " Garak " for flute and piano ( 1963 ) -- he drew inspiration from Chinese and Korean court music , blending exotic tone-production techniques with the angular Western style he had developed at Darmstadt . <br><blue>17</blue>His style continued to evolve through the 1970 's , when he was using what he called " main-tone technique , " a method in which grand textures were woven around central melodic figures . <br><blue>18</blue>And by the mid-1980 's , the sometimes acerbic edges of his early style had softened . <br><blue>19</blue>In recent works like " Distanzen " ( 1988 ) , string and wind quintets play off each other , creating a magical shimmer that eludes stylistic classification . <br><blue>20</blue>Mr. Yun also composed four operas on Korean and Taoist themes , as well as five symphonies and numerous vocal and chamber works . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>South Korea</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>South Korea</m_str> (7_4) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>1963</m_str> (16_35) 	<m_str>1963</m_str> (16_47) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>his early style</m_str> (18_12) 	<m_str>His style</m_str> (17_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (4_49) 	<m_str>South Korean agents</m_str> (4_35) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Darmstadt</m_str> (14_50) 	<m_str>Darmstadt</m_str> (16_73) 	<br><blue>6(31)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_50) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (14_31) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>Isang Yun , a Korean-born German composer of powerful</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_69) 	<m_str>Mr. Yun</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Yun</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_26) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_25) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (4_39) 	<m_str>Mr. Yun</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_41) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_12) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_16) 	<m_str>Soo Ya Yun</m_str> (4_44) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_12) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>His wife</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his wife , Soo Ya Yun , from their West Berlin apartment</m_str> (4_41) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Tongyong</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>Tongyong</m_str> (13_12) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>the West German Government and a petition from a large group of Western composers and performers</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (8_1) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>West Berlin</m_str> (4_50) 	<m_str>West Berlin</m_str> (15_8) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>Berlin</m_str> (1_22) 	<m_str>Berlin</m_str> (14_46) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
