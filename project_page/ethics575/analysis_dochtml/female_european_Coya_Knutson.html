<blue>1</blue>Former Representative Coya Knutson of Minnesota , a fierce champion of family farms , medical research and campaign finance reform and the creator of Federal student loans , died at a nursing home in Edina , Minn. , on Thursday , her legislative achievements all but overshadowed by her vindictive husband 's '' Coya , Come Home '' campaign that led to her defeat after two terms in 1958 . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 82 . <br><blue>3</blue>Her son , Terry , said the cause was kidney failure . <br><blue>4</blue>If there had ever been any doubts that a woman 's place is in the House , they must surely have been dispelled in 1954 when the former Coya Gjesdal unseated a six-term Republican and swept into Congress like a whirlwind from northern Minnesota . <br><blue>5</blue>There had been women in Congress continuously for more than 30 years , and Mrs. Knutson , although the first from Minnesota , was one of seven elected in 1954 . <br><blue>6</blue>But it is safe to say that the House had never seen anything quite like her . <br><blue>7</blue>A Norwegian immigrant 's daughter who grew up on a North Dakota farm , graduated from Concordia College in 1934 and spent a year studying voice and piano at the Juilliard School before returning to North Dakota to teach school , she married in 1940 and settled in the little town of Oklee , Minn. , just across the state line . <br><blue>8</blue>She and her husband operated a small hotel cum cafe until Mrs. Knutson , a populist inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt , got the political bug and made a successful run for the Minnesota Legislature in 1950 . <br><blue>9</blue>A tireless campaigner who accompanied herself on the accordion while singing her own campaign song in a lilting soprano , she stunned the Minnesota political establishment when she won the 1954 Congressional election , and when she got to Washington she stunned Congress even more . <br><blue>10</blue>Despite her lack of seniority , Mrs. Knutson promptly won a place on the House Agriculture Committee . <br><blue>11</blue>She subsequently initiated the first Federal appropriations for cystic fibrosis research , introduced the first bill calling for the income tax checkoff to finance Presidential election campaigns and originated the idea and the legislation that established the Federal student loan program . <br><blue>12</blue>Mrs. Knutson was an independent-minded woman , and she made her share of political enemies along the way . <br><blue>13</blue>But , despite opposition from some leaders of her own Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party , she appeared headed for a long and brilliant career in Congress as her second term drew to a close . <br><blue>14</blue>Then , in May 1958 , when her party declined to formally endorse Mrs. Knutson for a third term , forcing her to run in a primary to seek re-election , Andy Knutson , the farmhand she had married 18 years earlier , dropped a bombshell . <br><blue>15</blue>In an open letter to his wife , he urged her to leave Congress and return to what he described as the '' happy home we once enjoyed . '' <br><blue>16</blue>Never mind that Mr. Knutson , who had once worked on her father 's farm in North Dakota , had not shared a bedroom with his wife for years or that he had regularly beaten her so badly during her visits to Minnesota , as their son later recalled it , that she had to wear dark glasses to hide her black eyes from her fellow members of Congress . <br><blue>17</blue>Once the resulting '' Coya , Come Home , '' newspaper headline was carried across the country , it created a firestorm of publicity that accepted Mr. Knutson 's story as the plaintive truth and portrayed his wife as an uncaring wife who had abandoned her family for political ambition . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Knutson later stirred the fire by accusing his wife of having an affair with a legislative aide half her age , but although the charge was a blatant fabrication , Mrs. Knutson refused to denounce her husband . <br><blue>19</blue>She managed to win the primary , but lost the general election by 1,390 votes to Odin Langen , a Republican who was 6 feet 4 inches tall and campaigned on the slogan , '' A Big Man for a Man-Sized Job . '' <br><blue>20</blue>There was never any doubt that the '' Coya , Come Home , '' campaign had cost Mrs. Knutson the election , and as it turned out , her political career . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>: <m_str>the election</m_str> (20_20) 	<m_str>the 1954 Congressional election</m_str> (9_30) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (20_25) 	<m_str>the general election</m_str> (19_10) 	<br><blue>2(5)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (16_32) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_26) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>her party</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>her own Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party</m_str> (13_9) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>her father 's</m_str> (16_12) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (16_50) 	<m_str>a bedroom</m_str> (16_23) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>his wife</m_str> (17_37) 	<m_str>his wife for years</m_str> (16_26) 	<m_str>his wife of having an affair with a legislative aide half her age</m_str> (18_9) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>Minnesota</m_str> (9_24) 	<m_str>Minnesota</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>Minnesota</m_str> (5_22) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>her vindictive husband 's</m_str> (1_49) 	<m_str>her husband</m_str> (18_37) 	<m_str>her husband</m_str> (8_3) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>1954</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>1954</m_str> (9_31) 	<m_str>1954</m_str> (4_25) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the House</m_str> (4_15) 	<m_str>the House</m_str> (6_8) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (17_19) 	<m_str>newspaper headline</m_str> (17_11) 	<br><blue>12(7)</blue>: <m_str>Congress</m_str> (9_43) 	<m_str>Congress</m_str> (13_24) 	<m_str>Congress</m_str> (16_69) 	<m_str>we</m_str> (15_26) 	<m_str>Congress</m_str> (4_38) 	<m_str>Congress</m_str> (5_6) 	<m_str>Congress</m_str> (15_14) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>North Dakota</m_str> (16_17) 	<m_str>North Dakota</m_str> (7_11) 	<br><blue>14(52)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (14_22) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_11) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_3) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_37) 	<m_str>Former Representative Coya Knutson of Minnesota , a fierce champion of family farms , medical research and campaign finance reform and the creator of Federal student loans</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_12) 	<m_str>herself</m_str> (9_6) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_42) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>Coya</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_21) 	<m_str>Mrs. Knutson</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_36) 	<m_str>Mr. Knutson</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_28) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_40) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_42) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Knutson 's</m_str> (17_27) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_37) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_49) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_41) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_53) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_37) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_20) 	<m_str>Coya</m_str> (1_54) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_61) 	<m_str>Mrs. Knutson</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_46) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_63) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_65) 	<m_str>Mrs. Knutson</m_str> (18_32) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_37) 	<m_str>Coya</m_str> (20_9) 	<m_str>the former Coya Gjesdal</m_str> (4_27) 	<m_str>Mrs. Knutson</m_str> (5_15) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>Mrs. Knutson</m_str> (20_18) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_14) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_29) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_26) 	<m_str>Mrs. Knutson for a third term</m_str> (14_14) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
