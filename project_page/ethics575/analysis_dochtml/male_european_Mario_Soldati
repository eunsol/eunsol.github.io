<blue>1</blue>Mario Soldati , a prolific Italian writer and film director , died on Saturday at his home in Tellaro , near La Spezia . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 92 . <br><blue>3</blue>Although Mr. Soldati became a household name in Italy as the director of 29 films from 1931 to 1960 , writing was thought to be his stronger talent . <br><blue>4</blue>In a career spanning nearly 70 years , he successfully tried his hand at journalism , short stories , poetry , novels and screenplays , many of which celebrated the quirkiness of human nature . <br><blue>5</blue>Born into an aristocratic family in Turin and educated by the Jesuits , Mr. Soldati spent his youth rebelling against his controlling mother , his narrow-minded upbringing and a severe church school . <br><blue>6</blue>He wrote his first theater work -- a farce about Pontius Pilate -- while studying art history at Turin University and gained critical recognition with the 1929 publication of '' Salmace , '' a collection of short stories . <br><blue>7</blue>But it was n't until '' America Primo Amore , '' an amusing account of his two-year stay in New York on a fellowship , that he came into prominence . <br><blue>8</blue>New York , and Times Square in particular , provided Mr. Soldati with colorful material for his writing . <br><blue>9</blue>When his money ran out , he accepted a teaching position at Columbia University and contemplated seeking United States citizenship . <br><blue>10</blue>Upon returning to Italy with an American wife , he found that he was unable to get work as a journalist because of his refusal to join the Fascist Party . <br><blue>11</blue>Instead , he began working as a screenwriter in Rome and soon was directing his own pictures . <br><blue>12</blue>His films , which included '' La Provinciale '' ( 1952 ) , starring Gina Lollobrigida and based on a novel by Alberto Moravia ; '' Piccolo Mondo Antico '' ( 1940 ) and '' Malombra '' ( 1942 ) , were widely popular . <br><blue>13</blue>He also directed light operas . <br><blue>14</blue>When his first marriage ended , he married an actress named Jucci Kellerman , with whom he had three sons . <br><blue>15</blue>He eventually left Rome to work as a full-time writer , settling in a villa on the Ligurian coast . <br><blue>16</blue>In 40 years of writing he produced a string of novels and short stories , among them '' The Emerald , '' '' The Capri Letters , '' a study of two Americans in post-World War II Italy , and '' La Confessione . '' <br><blue>17</blue>His '' L'Attore '' ( '' The Actor '' ) , a study of psychological evil , won Venice 's Campiello Prize in 1970 . <br><blue>18</blue>In the early 1950 's , he decided to explore the new medium of television and started making documentaries , including '' Travels Along the Po Searching for Genuine Food . '' ' <br><blue>19</blue>He was also considered the father of Italian television criticism . <br><blue>20</blue>Until his death , he continued to contribute short stories , at the rate of two a month , to the Milan newspaper Il Giorno . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Rome</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>Rome</m_str> (11_10) 	<br><blue>2(35)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_24) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_9) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_27) 	<m_str>Mr. Soldati</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_16) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Soldati</m_str> (5_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Soldati</m_str> (3_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_17) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Columbia University</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>Turin University</m_str> (6_19) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (16_17) 	<m_str>novels</m_str> (16_11) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
