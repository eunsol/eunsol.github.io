 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>Eric R. Wolf , an accidental anthropologist whose cultural studies of Latin American peoples and European peasants helped enrich an already eclectic field even as he challenged some established cultural assumptions , died on Sunday at his home in Irvington , N.Y . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 76 and had taught at Lehman College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was liver cancer , his family said . <br><blue>4</blue>For someone who had had an intense fascination with the sometimes striking cultural differences of diverse peoples since his grade school days in polyglot Vienna and his teen-age years in strife-torn Sudetenland , Dr. Wolf -- whose father was Austrian and mother Russian -- did not immediately see anthropology as his natural academic outlet . <br><blue>5</blue>Even after he came to the United States with his parents and settled in Jackson Heights , Queens , Dr. Wolf , whose father had operated a textile factory in the Sudetenland before the 1938 Nazi takeover , saw biology as the best bet to explain human differences . <br><blue>6</blue>But after enrolling in Queens College planning to major in biochemistry , he stumbled into an anthropology class one day and realized that the broad field embraced just about everything he was interested in , which was just about everything about every aspect of the human experience . <br><blue>7</blue>After interrupting his education to serve with the Army in the Alps in World War II , Dr. Wolf received a degree in anthropology in 1946 and went on to Columbia University on the G.I. bill , receiving a doctorate in 1951 . <br><blue>8</blue>Before joining City University in 1971 as a distinguished professor , he had brief teaching stints at the University of Illinois , the University of Virginia , Yale University and the University of Chicago and nine years as a professor at the University of Michigan . <br><blue>9</blue>By then he had already established his reputation as an innovative and iconoclastic academic , whose credentials included helping to organize one of the earliest Vietnam teach-ins , at Michigan in 1965 . <br><blue>10</blue>His 1959 book about Mexico , for example , '' Sons of the Shaking Earth , '' raised eyebrows among established anthropologists -- even as it established a fertile trend -- by drawing on archaeology , history and other alien fields to trace the diverse cultural development of Mexico . <br><blue>11</blue>It is a reflection of the book 's power , as well as of Dr. Wolf 's clear and graceful writing style , that it is still used in introductory anthropology courses . <br><blue>12</blue>In writing the book , Dr. Wolf not only made unorthodox use of scholarship from other fields but also refined some of his own unorthodox ideas about the very nature of culture . <br><blue>13</blue>Long seen by anthropologists as a stable set of attitudes and practices that defined various peoples and differentiated them from others , culture , as Dr. Wolf came to see it , was a far more dynamic process that involved endless practical , psychological and other reactions to changing economic and other conditions . <br><blue>14</blue>To Dr. Wolf , who outlined his position in a 1964 book , '' Anthropology , '' the notion of unified and unchanging cultures amounted to little more than misleading ethnic stereotyping , sweeping generalizations that failed to notice or account for the variety of differences within a single culture . <br><blue>15</blue>Having concluded that established cultural anthropologists tended to neglect many nonconforming elements of a given society , Dr. Wolf helped rectify things with his 1966 book , '' Peasants , '' which traced the common threads of peasantry in otherwise diverse European cultures . <br><blue>16</blue>In 1982 he developed another favorite theme , the sometimes cataclysmic impact of colonial capitalism on indigenous cultures , with '' Europe and the People Without History , '' which tracked the impact of colonial economic expansion on less developed societies . <br><blue>17</blue>If Dr. Wolf was a champion of the idea that all people , even tribal societies and peasants , are equally important , he also practiced that philosophy in his life as a teacher or , as he saw himself , as a perpetual student for whom life was an endless and delightful field trip . <br><blue>18</blue>A brilliant man known for his charming and uncanny ability to make even ordinary people feel he was intensely interested in them , as indeed he was , Dr. Wolf was such a nurturing teacher that he was the preferred go-to guy when his students came up with brilliant but untested ideas . <br><blue>19</blue>While other professors , they knew , might dismiss such brainstorms as harebrained , Dr. Wolf could be counted on to become as excited as they were . <br><blue>20</blue>Even after his retirement in 1992 , Dr. Wolf , who was awarded a $ 375,000 MacArthur Foundation '' genius grant '' in 1990 , continued his quest for new answers to old questions , among them the explanation for the Nazis ' rise to power
