<blue>1</blue>Adolph Lowe , an adviser to the Weimar Government in Germany in the 1920 's and a professor of political economy at the New School for Social Research for nearly four decades , died in Wolfenbuttel , Germany , on June 3 . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 102 . <br><blue>3</blue>One of a remarkable generation of Jewish intellectuals who immigrated to the United States in the 1930 's and early 1940 's , Professor Lowe was the last surviving member of the University in Exile , created in 1933 by the founders of the New School and the New York State Legislature expressly to snatch scholars like Professor Lowe from the jaws of fascism . <br><blue>4</blue>Professor Lowe was born in Stuttgart , a sleepy little city in southern Germany , in 1893 . <br><blue>5</blue>The son of a traveling salesman , he started out studying law , but the economic and political upheavals around the time of World War I turned him to economics and socialism . <br><blue>6</blue>After that war Professor Lowe , armed with a doctorate , became an adviser to the ill-fated Weimar Government in the ministries of demobilization , labor and economics . <br><blue>7</blue>By the spring of 1933 , when Hitler issued his first blacklist of " dangerous intellectuals , " including Professor Lowe , the philosopher Paul Tillich and the sociologist Karl Mannheim , Professor Lowe had become a highly visible professor of economics at the University of Frankfurt with a large student following . <br><blue>8</blue>His popularity was as much personal as political . <br><blue>9</blue>Diminutive and dynamic , Professor Lowe was an entertaining lecturer and avid amateur musician who frequently invited his students home for parties . <br><blue>10</blue>His daughter Rachel Aubrey , a psychotherapist who lives in Manhattan , recalled that Professor Lowe regularly insisted that students who were having trouble finishing their dissertations live with his family until the task could be completed under his watchful eye . <br><blue>11</blue>Fleeing Frankfurt in the middle of the night just before the Nazis stripped Jews of their passports , the Lowe family went to Geneva and then England , where Professor Lowe spent the next half decade at the London School of Economics and the University of Manchester . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1941 , in the middle of the blitzkrieg , Professor Lowe finally accepted an invitation from Alvin Johnson , president of the New School , to come to New York . <br><blue>13</blue>Professor Lowe spent the rest of his career at the New School , where his broad , interdisciplinary approach to economics influenced several generations of students . <br><blue>14</blue>" Lowe brought with him a tradition that saw no boundaries between economics , sociology and political science , " said the economist Robert Heilbroner , the author of " The Worldly Philosophers . " <br><blue>15</blue>" Lowe was very impatient with artificial boundaries . " <br><blue>16</blue>Initially an enthusiastic disciple of John Maynard Keynes , the British economist and patron saint of government management of the economy , Professor Lowe later became one of Keynesianism 's early critics . <br><blue>17</blue>He argued that the effort to turn economics into a predictive science was futile and that the evolution of a highly organized society could not be mapped out with mathematical models , large or small . <br><blue>18</blue>In that insight , he anticipated the position that most economists had embraced by the mid-1980 's . <br><blue>19</blue>Professor Lowe retired from the New School in 1978 . <br><blue>20</blue>After his wife , Beatrice , died in 1982 , he moved back to Germany to live with a daughter , Hanna Lustig , who had settled in Wolfenbuttel with her family . <br><hr><br><blue>1(7)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (7_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_39) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_30) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_18) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Hitler</m_str> (7_8) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Lowe family</m_str> (11_19) 	<m_str>her family</m_str> (20_31) 	<m_str>his family</m_str> (10_30) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the middle of the night</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>the middle of the blitzkrieg</m_str> (12_5) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>that war</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>World War</m_str> (5_24) 	<br><blue>5(25)</blue>: <m_str>Lowe</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (3_24) 	<m_str>including Professor Lowe , the philosopher Paul Tillich and the sociologist Karl Mannheim</m_str> (7_19) 	<m_str>Lowe</m_str> (11_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (7_33) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (11_30) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_8) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_11) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (16_23) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe , armed with a doctorate</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_15) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (3_58) 	<m_str>Lowe</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (5_28) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>Professor Lowe</m_str> (10_15) 	<br><blue>6(5)</blue>: <m_str>the New School</m_str> (3_44) 	<m_str>the New School</m_str> (12_23) 	<m_str>the New School</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>the New School for Social Research for nearly four decades</m_str> (1_23) 	<m_str>the New School</m_str> (19_5) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (10_26) 	<m_str>students who were having trouble finishing their dissertations</m_str> (10_20) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>Germany</m_str> (20_15) 	<m_str>Wolfenbuttel , Germany</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>Germany</m_str> (1_11) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Nazis</m_str> (11_11) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (11_16) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
