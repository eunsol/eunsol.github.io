<blue>1</blue>Glenn Ford , a laconic , soft-spoken actor with an easy smile who played leading roles in many westerns , melodramas and romantic films from the early 1940 's through the 60 's , died yesterday at his Beverly Hills home . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 90 . <br><blue>3</blue>Paramedics called to the home shortly before 4 p.m. found him dead , the police said . <br><blue>4</blue>He had a series of strokes in the 1990 's . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Ford , who had the ability to project a taut resoluteness and inner strength along with affability and gentleness , was never nominated for an Academy Award , although his acting consistently won high praise from critics and he was popular with moviegoers , especially in the 1950 's . <br><blue>6</blue>He started his Hollywood career seemingly typecast as an actor who could do well in undistinguished films . <br><blue>7</blue>He thus made a series of B movies for Columbia Pictures , playing featured roles in such forgettable productions as '' Men Without Souls '' and '' My Son Is Guilty '' ( both in 1940 ) and '' Texas , '' '' The Desperadoes '' and '' Destroyer '' ( all in 1941 ) . <br><blue>8</blue>He usually attracted critical praise even when the script , production and direction were anything but praiseworthy . <br><blue>9</blue>In 1946 , for example , Mr. Ford starred opposite Rita Hayworth in '' Gilda , '' a film remembered mostly as the vehicle for her provocative rendition of a song called '' Put the Blame on Mame . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Writing in The New York Times , Bosley Crowther praised Mr. Ford 's '' stamina and poise in a thankless role . '' <br><blue>11</blue>But in the 1950 's , Mr. Ford began to make pictures that were more consistent with the ability he had repeatedly demonstrated . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1955 , he played an idealistic , beleaguered teacher in '' Blackboard Jungle , '' which was about daily life in what was then regarded as a tough New York City high school . <br><blue>13</blue>Gwyllyn Samuel Newton Ford was born on May 1 , 1916 , in Quebec , the only child of Newton and Hannah Ford . <br><blue>14</blue>The Fords were of Welsh descent , and the family was quite prominent in Canada . <br><blue>15</blue>Newton Ford was a railroad executive and mill owner who was a nephew of Sir John MacDonald , a former prime minister of Canada . <br><blue>16</blue>Another Ford ancestor was Martin Van Buren , the eighth president of the United States . <br><blue>17</blue>Gwyllyn , soon to be called Glenn , was initially reared in Portneuf , Quebec , an hour away from the city . <br><blue>18</blue>When he was 7 , his family moved to Santa Monica , Calif. , where Mr. Ford was educated . <br><blue>19</blue>After high school , he began working with small theater groups . <br><blue>20</blue>He later said his father had no objection to his son 's growing interest in acting but told him : '' It 's all right for you to try to act , if you learn something else first . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the family</m_str> (14_9) 	<m_str>his family</m_str> (18_6) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (9_26) 	<m_str>opposite Rita Hayworth</m_str> (9_10) 	<br><blue>3(26)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Ford</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Ford 's</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_38) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_6) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>the police</m_str> (3_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Ford</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Ford</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>his father</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_10) 	<m_str>his son 's</m_str> (20_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (20_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_31) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_40) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>1950 's</m_str> (5_49) 	<m_str>1950 's</m_str> (11_4) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Canada</m_str> (15_24) 	<m_str>Canada</m_str> (14_15) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>you</m_str> (20_34) 	<m_str>you</m_str> (20_27) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Newton Ford</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>Ford</m_str> (16_2) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Gwyllyn Samuel Newton Ford</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>Gwyllyn</m_str> (17_1) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
