         <h1>Geoffrey Bawa, 83, Architect Who Blended Asian Styles </h1>

 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>Geoffrey Bawa , a Sri Lankan architect whose striking blend of traditional Asian forms and contemporary international styles produced houses and public buildings in harmony with their Asian landscapes , died on Tuesday at his home in the capital , Colombo . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 83 . <br><blue>3</blue>In 1998 , a stroke left him paralyzed and unable to speak , but working from his home he continued to oversee projects being carried out by his associates in Sri Lanka and India . <br><blue>4</blue>In a citation in 2001 honoring Mr. Bawa , the Aga Khan Foundation said : '' He has broken down the artificial segregation of inside and outside , building and landscape ; he has drawn on tradition to create an architecture that is fitting to its place , and he has also used his vast knowledge of the modern world to create an architecture that is of its time . '' <br><blue>5</blue>As Sri Lanka , formerly Ceylon , emerged as an international tourist destination in the 1960 's , Mr. Bawa designed a series of luxurious hotels that set a new standard for resorts in Asia , each one integrated into its unique location . <br><blue>6</blue>Travelers who stay in hotels he designed never get the sense that they could be at any resort anywhere in the tropics . <br><blue>7</blue>The neighborhood is always the dominant influence in a Bawa building . <br><blue>8</blue>For example , from the approach to the Triton Hotel in Ahungalla , on Sri Lanka 's west coast , a reflective pool shaded by coconut trees seems to flow across the lobby to meet another pool and the Indian Ocean beyond . <br><blue>9</blue>The last thing the eye sees is the hotel itself . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Bawa did not reject colonial influences of the Portuguese , British or Dutch if they stood up to architectural scrutiny . <br><blue>11</blue>The Lighthouse , another seaside hotel at Galle , a colonial-era port on Sri Lanka 's southwest tip , has a fortresslike air at ground level that reflects the Dutch-British fort that dominates the town . <br><blue>12</blue>To build the Kandalama Hotel , a serpentine structure in central Sri Lanka clinging to a hillside near Dambulla , with its ancient Sinhalese Buddhist cave temples , workers used no heavy earthmoving equipment that would have disrupted the protected environment or sacred atmosphere . <br><blue>13</blue>Boulders and streams were integrated into the building , which overlooks a lake . <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Bawa , who rode around Sri Lanka in a vintage Rolls-Royce and entertained elegantly , also designed houses that integrated the lush Sri Lankan environment into living space , freeing at least the elite who could afford his homes from the dense , often-claustrophobic bungalows of the British colonial era . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1979 , the Sri Lankan government gave him his largest assignment : to design a new Parliament building . <br><blue>16</blue>The brooding structure , with copper-roofed pavilions following the traditional lines of precolonial temples and palaces , seems to float on a sheet of water created from marshland at Kotte , about five miles from central Colombo . <br><blue>17</blue>In 1980 , Mr. Bawa was commissioned to create a new university , Ruhunu , near Matara on the island 's south coast . <br><blue>18</blue>A prolific designer , he also produced plans for buildings at little or no cost for primary schools and for at least one orphanage . <br><blue>19</blue>Geoffrey Bawa was born on July 23 , 1919 , in what was the British colony of Ceylon . <br><blue>20</blue>His father was a lawyer whose ancestors were British and Sri Lankan Muslim , a community that considers itself an ethnic group as much as a religion . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>Travelers who stay in hotels he designed never</m_str> (6_1)
