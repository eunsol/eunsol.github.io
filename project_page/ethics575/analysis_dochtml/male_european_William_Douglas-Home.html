<blue>1</blue>William Douglas-Home , a prolific English playwright of light comedy , died on Monday at his home in Winchester , England . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 80 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>He died of a heart attack , said his niece , Caroline Douglas-Home . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Douglas-Home , several of whose works made it to Broadway and the screen , drew on his own aristocratic background to enliven the stage with the upper classes , lords and ladies of the realm and their sometimes eccentric antics . <br><blue>5</blue>Another source was his political exposure as a three-time unsuccessful candidate for Parliament and brother of former Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home , now Lord Home . <br><blue>6</blue>A son of the 13th Earl of Home ( pronounced hume ) , he came from a family military tradition that stretched back to the battle of Flodden in 1513 . <br><blue>7</blue>In 1944 , when he was 32 years old , he was court-martialed for " not obeying a lawful command " as an army officer . <br><blue>8</blue>He was imprisoned for a year and dishonorably discharged . <br><blue>9</blue>His offense was to refuse orders in an attack on the French port Le Havre in World War II . <br><blue>10</blue>He said a foolish insistence on unconditional surrender would have forced him to bombard German soldiers who were unwilling to fight anymore but whose commander refused to surrender unconditionally . <br><blue>11</blue>He also cited the danger to countless French civilians . <br><blue>12</blue>Years later , he declared that by today 's standards he could have been guilty of a war crime had he taken part in the action on Sept. 8 , 1944 . <br><blue>13</blue>More than 2,000 French civilians died , and Captain Douglas-Home of the Royal Armored Corps became something of a hero to their survivors . <br><blue>14</blue>King of the Drawing Room By the 1950 's Mr. Douglas-Home , whose plays had begun to be produced before the war , was considered the king of light English comedy of the drawing-room genre . <br><blue>15</blue>He then had a dry spell but made a comeback in the late 1960 's . <br><blue>16</blue>In between , some of his plays received rough treatment in London . <br><blue>17</blue>The Daily Mail panned " The Cigarette Girl " ( 1962 ) as " unspeakable drivel . " <br><blue>18</blue>But others among the more than 40 plays he wrote over four decades were solid hits with the public . <br><blue>19</blue>Among those produced on Broadway were " The Chiltern Hundreds " and " Yes , M'Lord " ( both 1949 ) . <br><blue>20</blue>" The Reluctant Debutante " ( 1956 ) with Wilfrid Hyde-White and Adrienne was generally welcomed by the New York critics for being witty and droll . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>the New York critics</m_str> (20_18) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>More than 2,000 French civilians</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (13_22) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>whose plays</m_str> (14_13) 	<m_str>his plays</m_str> (16_6) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Captain Douglas-Home of the Royal Armored Corps</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>the 1950 's Mr. Douglas-Home , whose plays had begun to be produced before the war</m_str> (14_7) 	<br><blue>5(23)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_16) 	<m_str>William Douglas-Home , a prolific English playwright of light comedy</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>his niece , Caroline Douglas-Home</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Douglas-Home , several of whose works made it to Broadway and the screen</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_9) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (16_12) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
