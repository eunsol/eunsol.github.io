<blue>1</blue>Adam Osborne , a British technical writer who became one of Silicon Valley 's legends by introducing the first portable personal computer in 1981 , died on March 18 in Kodiakanal , India . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 64 and had a series of strokes in the last decade , said his former wife Cynthia Geddes . <br><blue>3</blue>The Osborne 1 computer , which was introduced at the West Coast Computer Faire in June 1981 , was a 24-pound luggable machine that came with a large library of essential software , including a word processor , spreadsheet , database and programming languages . <br><blue>4</blue>At the time , it was a startling innovation in an industry that was dominated by a do-it-yourself hobbyist culture . <br><blue>5</blue>Dr. Osborne distinguished the Osborne Computer by noting that it was '' adequate , '' a break with the superlative-filled industry promotion of the era . '' <br><blue>6</blue>I liken myself to Henry Ford and the auto industry , '' he said in a 1982 interview . '' <br><blue>7</blue>I give you 90 percent of what most people need . '' <br><blue>8</blue>The machine created a sensation in the rapidly growing PC marketplace , even though it came with a cramped five-inch display screen . <br><blue>9</blue>The common belief at the time was that customers were paying for the software , which included popular programs like WordStar , the SuperCalc spreadsheet and Bill Gates 's version of the Basic programming language and were getting the computer free . <br><blue>10</blue>The Osborne Computer Corporation in Hayward , Calif. , became synonymous with the Silicon Valley tradition of hypergrowth defined by companies like Apple Computer and Atari . <br><blue>11</blue>Orders for the Osborne 1 totaled 8,000 in 1981 and jumped to 110,000 in 1982 . <br><blue>12</blue>At one point , the company said that it had a 25-month backlog of orders . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1982 , Dr. Osborne , who was an enthusiastic pitchman with a stylish British accent , prematurely announced the second-generation Osborne , called the Executive . <br><blue>14</blue>When the company encountered manufacturing difficulties , it found itself drowning in inventory as customers deferred purchases of the original machine in expectation of the new one . <br><blue>15</blue>The computer maker became an iconic symbol of Silicon Valley 's boom-and-bust economy on Sept. 13 , 1983 , when it declared bankruptcy and a local newspaper photographer captured Dr. Osborne covering his face with his briefcase as he headed for his car in the company parking lot . <br><blue>16</blue>Although the industry focused on the company 's management and logistical problems , at the time Osborne was feeling increasing competition from I.B.M. as well as other makers of portable computers including Kaypro , Corona and Compaq . <br><blue>17</blue>Several industry experts have said the company 's collapse had as much to do with its failure to jump quickly to a 16-bit microprocessor and I.B.M. compatibility . <br><blue>18</blue>Dr. Osborne was born in Thailand in 1939 to British parents . <br><blue>19</blue>He grew up in southern India , where his father , the writer Arthur Osborne , a devotee of Sri Ramana Maharshi , helped popularize ideas from Eastern religion in the West . <br><blue>20</blue>Dr. Osborne moved to England as a teenager and received a degree in chemical engineering from Birmingham University . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the time</m_str> (4_2) 	<m_str>the time</m_str> (9_5) 	<br><blue>2(11)</blue>: <m_str>the company 's</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>The machine</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>the company</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (17_16) 	<m_str>the company</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (15_21) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (8_15) 	<m_str>the company 's</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>itself</m_str> (14_10) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>The Osborne 1 computer , which was introduced at the West Coast Computer Faire in June 1981</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (4_5) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>an industry that was dominated by a do-it-yourself hobbyist culture</m_str> (4_11) 	<m_str>the industry</m_str> (16_2) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>Silicon Valley</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>Silicon Valley 's</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>Silicon Valley 's</m_str> (1_12) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>the computer</m_str> (9_39) 	<m_str>the Osborne Computer</m_str> (5_4) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (5_10) 	<br><blue>7(5)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (15_33) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_36) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_39) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_42) 	<m_str>a local newspaper photographer</m_str> (15_25) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>I.B.M.</m_str> (16_23) 	<m_str>I.B.M.</m_str> (17_26) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>1982</m_str> (6_17) 	<m_str>1982</m_str> (11_15) 	<m_str>1982</m_str> (13_2) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>Birmingham University</m_str> (20_17) 	<br><blue>11(17)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>the writer Arthur Osborne</m_str> (19_12) 	<m_str>Dr. Osborne</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Osborne</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Osborne</m_str> (16_17) 	<m_str>Dr. Osborne , who was an enthusiastic pitchman with a stylish British accent , prematurely announced the second-generation Osborne</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>myself</m_str> (6_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (2_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>the second-generation Osborne</m_str> (13_20) 	<m_str>Dr. Osborne</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Osborne</m_str> (3_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>the Osborne 1</m_str> (11_3) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>the company 's management</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>the company 's collapse</m_str> (17_6) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
