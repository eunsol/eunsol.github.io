<blue>1</blue>Frederick Vanderbilt Field , who supported Communist causes in the 1930 's , 40 's and 50 's and was once described as '' the Reds ' pet blueblood , '' died Feb. 1 at the Walker Methodist Health Center in Minneapolis . <br><blue>2</blue>A great-great-grandson of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt and a descendant of several other prestigious American families , he was 94 and had lived in Minneapolis for almost two decades . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Field first ventured into politics when he offered his services to the Democratic Party after returning to the United States from a year at the London School of Economics . <br><blue>4</blue>He had previously been interested in socialist ideas , and when he discovered that Democratic Party leaders were not in a great hurry to change society , he drifted further in socialism 's direction . <br><blue>5</blue>He began to proclaim the gospel of socialism at every opportunity and made a number of street-corner speeches , although he later said they were not very good . <br><blue>6</blue>He first publicly proclaimed his adherence to the socialist cause in 1928 , when he announced that he intended to vote for Norman Thomas , the Socialist Party candidate for president . <br><blue>7</blue>He was cut off without a penny by Frederick Vanderbilt , his great-uncle , for whom he had been named . <br><blue>8</blue>Frederick Vanderbilt , who had no children , had earlier said he would leave his fortune , estimated at more than $ 70 million Depression-era dollars , to his namesake . <br><blue>9</blue>Socialism paled within a half-dozen years for Mr. Field , who termed it '' a splendid shell of an idea without anything important growing inside it . '' <br><blue>10</blue>His disillusionment moved him further to the left . <br><blue>11</blue>After his return from London , he also went to work for the Institute of Pacific Relations , a federation of 10 national councils working to solve the problems of the Pacific area . <br><blue>12</blue>The organization was considered respectable throughout most of the 1930 's , but the Soviet Union became increasingly influential after joining in 1931 , and when Congressional investigators began searching for Communists after World War II , the institute was represented as an umbrella for subversives . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Field remained with the organization until 1940 and was on its board until 1947 . <br><blue>14</blue>In the 40 's , Mr. Field was an organizer and executive secretary of the American Peace Mobilization , an organization with ties to the Soviet Union that was dedicated to keeping the United States from entering the war . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1941 the group picketed the White House for more than 1,000 hours . <br><blue>16</blue>The picketing ended suddenly when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union . <br><blue>17</blue>One of Mr. Field 's sisters said that until the early 40 's he had considered himself as good an American as anyone else . <br><blue>18</blue>When the United States entered the war , he tried to get a commission in Army intelligence but was turned down as a security risk . <br><blue>19</blue>That rejection , his sister said , was the final straw . <br><blue>20</blue>He became dedicated to Communism , although whether he joined the party was never known . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Soviet Union</m_str> (16_9) 	<m_str>the Soviet Union</m_str> (12_14) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the institute</m_str> (12_38) 	<m_str>the Institute of Pacific Relations , a federation of 10 national councils working to solve the problems of the Pacific area</m_str> (11_13) 	<br><blue>3(5)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (9_26) 	<m_str>socialism 's</m_str> (4_32) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>Socialism</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>socialism</m_str> (5_8) 	<br><blue>4(36)</blue>: <m_str>Frederick Vanderbilt , his great-uncle , for whom he had been named</m_str> (7_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_17) 	<m_str>Frederick Vanderbilt , who had no children</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_15) 	<m_str>Mr. Field , who termed it</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_29) 	<m_str>Mr. Field 's</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt</m_str> (2_4) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (10_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (17_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (2_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Field</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Field</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_28) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>Mr. Field</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Minneapolis</m_str> (2_24) 	<m_str>Minneapolis</m_str> (1_42) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (14_33) 	<m_str>the United States</m_str> (18_2) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>the organization</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>The organization</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the war</m_str> (14_38) 	<m_str>the war</m_str> (18_6) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>to the Democratic Party</m_str> (3_12) 	<m_str>Socialist Party</m_str> (6_27) 	<m_str>Democratic Party</m_str> (4_15) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
