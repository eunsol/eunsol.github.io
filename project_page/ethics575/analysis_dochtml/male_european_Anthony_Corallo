<blue>1</blue>Anthony Corallo , the salty and stoical former boss of the Lucchese crime family who went to jail for life after the authorities overheard him chatting to his driver about the mob 's control of New York City 's construction industry , died Aug. 23 in a federal prison hospital in Springfield , Mo . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 87 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Corallo , who was serving a 100-year sentence , was said to be the oldest living gangster to have risen from one of the city 's five organized crime families . <br><blue>4</blue>He was a sitting member of the Mafia politburo , known as the commission , when he was arrested in 1985 . <br><blue>5</blue>A year later , he was found guilty on federal racketeering charges at what came to be known as the commission trial -- a 10-week smorgasbord of gangland lore that resulted in the conviction of the city 's top crime leaders . <br><blue>6</blue>It also paved the way for a new era of crime leader , a more rough-and-tumble crew of underlings , like John Gotti , who dressed in a flashy way and seemed to bask in the limelight . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Corallo , known to mobsters and federal agents alike as Tony Ducks -- because of his knack for ducking subpoenas and convictions -- was widely regarded as an old-time don , a crusty but gentle son of La Cosa Nostra , who believed in honor , staked his reputation on his word , adored his family and considered loose lips a treachery worse than murder . <br><blue>8</blue>It was in some ways curious , then , that investigators captured hours of conversation between him and his driver , Salvatore Avellino Jr. , by planting a listening device inside the dashboard of Mr. Avellino 's black Jaguar as it sat in a parking lot of the Huntington Town House , a Long Island catering hall , in 1982 . <br><blue>9</blue>The taped conversations became one of the primary building blocks of the federal case against Mr. Corallo and two other Mafia bosses -- Anthony Salerno of the Genovese family , who was known as Fat Tony , and Carmine Persico of the Colombo family , known as Junior -- as well as five other gangland counselors and underbosses . <br><blue>10</blue>Among the more dramatic allegations against Mr. Corallo and some of his co-defendants was the charge of conspiracy to murder Carmine Galante , the head of the Bonanno family , and two associates in 1979 . <br><blue>11</blue>They were killed in a hail of gunfire as they ate lunch on the patio of a Brooklyn restaurant . <br><blue>12</blue>The commission trial , which opened in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Sept. 9 , 1986 , and ended on Nov. 19 , 1986 , was a sort of Waterloo for the New York mob . <br><blue>13</blue>No previous trial had ever focused directly on the highest levels of Mafia leadership , and some investigators have said that the five families never truly recovered . <br><blue>14</blue>Anthony Corallo was born in 1913 and raised in East Harlem , where he worked , at least for a while , as a tile-setter . <br><blue>15</blue>He rose in the ranks of a Lucchese family that was governed at the time by Gaitano , or Tommy , Lucchese , whose illicit businesses from gambling and loan-sharking to truck hijacking and labor racketeering were centered in the Bronx . <br><blue>16</blue>When Mr. Lucchese died of cancer in 1967 , Mr. Corallo was the early favorite to be his successor . <br><blue>17</blue>But Mr. Corallo did not immediately get the job . <br><blue>18</blue>He was in prison for bribing James L. Marcus , then the New York City water commissioner , in exchange for contracts to clean and repair parts of the city 's enormous water reservoir system . <br><blue>19</blue>Carmine Tramunti was installed as the Lucchese boss , but when Mr. Tramunti himself was arrested a few years later , Mr. Corallo took over . <br><blue>20</blue>Mr. Corallo 's reign atop the Lucchese family was marked by an interest in labor racketeering , particularly in the private trash-hauling business and in million-dollar Manhattan construction projects . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Tramunti himself</m_str> (19_12) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>Carmine Tramunti</m_str> (19_1) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>his family</m_str> (7_56) 	<m_str>the Genovese family , who was known as Fat Tony</m_str> (9_27) 	<m_str>the Lucchese crime family who went to jail for life after the authorities overheard him chatting to his driver about the mob 's control of New York City 's construction industry</m_str> (1_11) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Manhattan</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>Manhattan</m_str> (20_27) 	<br><blue>5(20)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>Tony Ducks -- because of his knack for ducking subpoenas and convictions --</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Corallo 's</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (8_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Corallo</m_str> (19_22) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Corallo</m_str> (16_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Corallo</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_49) 	<m_str>Mr. Corallo</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_52) 	<m_str>Mr. Avellino 's</m_str> (8_35) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_56) 	<m_str>Anthony Corallo</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Corallo</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_14) 	<br><blue>6(5)</blue>: <m_str>the city 's</m_str> (18_29) 	<m_str>New York City</m_str> (18_13) 	<m_str>New York City 's</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>the city 's</m_str> (5_36) 	<m_str>the city 's</m_str> (3_25) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>the authorities</m_str> (1_22) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>Brooklyn</m_str> (11_18) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>the city 's five organized crime families</m_str> (3_25) 	<m_str>the five families</m_str> (13_22) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>New York City 's construction industry</m_str> (1_36) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (8_41) 	<m_str>a listening device</m_str> (8_28) 	<br><blue>12(7)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Corallo , who was serving a 100-year sentence</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_17) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (1_25) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_28) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Colombo family</m_str> (9_42) 	<m_str>the Bonanno family</m_str> (10_27) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>a Lucchese family</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>the Lucchese family</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mafia</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>Mafia</m_str> (9_21) 	<br><blue>16(5)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Lucchese</m_str> (16_2) 	<m_str>Tommy , Lucchese</m_str> (15_20) 	<m_str>Lucchese</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>Lucchese</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>Lucchese</m_str> (20_7) 	<br><blue>17(1)</blue>: <m_str>the limelight</m_str> (6_36) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
