<blue>1</blue>Isaac Stern , a violinist who in his prime was considered one of the great instrumentalists of the 20th century , and who also became an important power broker in the classical music world after he led a successful campaign to save Carnegie Hall from destruction , died at a Manhattan hospital on Saturday . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 81 and lived in Manhattan and Gaylordsville , Conn . <br><blue>3</blue>A spokeswoman for Carnegie Hall said he died from heart failure after an extended hospital stay . <br><blue>4</blue>The American classical music world has produced few images as characteristic as that of Mr. Stern , a violin in his hand and a pair of horn-rimmed eyeglasses perched atop his head . <br><blue>5</blue>It was the image of a musician at work -- typically rehearsing and persuading rather than performing , casual rather than formal , engaged rather than passive . <br><blue>6</blue>Countless photographs and caricatures , and miles of film and videotape , captured Mr. Stern preparing for concerts , coaching young ensembles during his master classes or proclaiming the glories of Carnegie Hall , of which he was president . <br><blue>7</blue>He was , in fact , nearly as well known for his devotion to Carnegie Hall as for his violin playing . <br><blue>8</blue>He gave more than 200 performances there , the first in 1943 . <br><blue>9</blue>When the hall was about to be demolished to make way for an office tower in 1960 -- the prevailing wisdom was that Lincoln Center , then under construction , would replace Carnegie -- Mr. Stern helped start a drive among musicians and the musical public that saved the hall . <br><blue>10</blue>He was then elected president of the Carnegie Hall Corporation , which runs the hall . <br><blue>11</blue>In that capacity , he played a central role in the restoration of the building in 1986 , and in the celebration of its centenary in 1991 . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1997 , the main concert hall was named the Isaac Stern Auditorium in honor of his efforts . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Stern was neither a child prodigy nor a flashy virtuoso , but he built his reputation in the mid-1940 's with a rich tone and emotional interpretive style . <br><blue>14</blue>He was passionate about a range of works that began with Baroque sonatas and concertos , encompassed the full Romantic and early 20th-century repertory , and included works composed with his warm , rounded sound in mind . <br><blue>15</blue>That sound was captured in a vast discography that documented the full scope of his repertory . <br><blue>16</blue>It was also heard in movie theaters : in 1946 , Mr. Stern played on the soundtrack of '' Humoresque , '' and when John Garfield was shown performing , it was Mr. Stern 's hands that were seen on the screen . <br><blue>17</blue>He played the Belgian violin virtuoso Eug√®ne Ysaye in the film '' Tonight We Sing '' in 1953 , and in 1970 he played on the soundtrack for '' Fiddler on the Roof . '' <br><blue>18</blue>He was also the subject of several documentaries , including '' From Mao to Mozart : Isaac Stern in China , '' which followed him on tour in 1979 and won an Academy Award for best full-length documentary in 1981 . <br><blue>19</blue>In the early 1960 's , when comparatively few soloists devoted time to chamber music , he teamed up with the pianist Eugene Istomin and the cellist Leonard Rose to perform and record as a trio . <br><blue>20</blue>He later undertook partnerships with the flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal , the cellist Yo-Yo Ma , the pianist Emanuel Ax and several other musicians . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>sound in mind</m_str> (14_35) 	<m_str>That sound</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (16_1) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the soundtrack of '' Humoresque</m_str> (16_16) 	<m_str>the soundtrack</m_str> (17_26) 	<br><blue>3(6)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_31) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_21) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>the classical music world</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>The American classical music world</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (5_1) 	<br><blue>5(31)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Stern</m_str> (4_15) 	<m_str>Mr. Stern</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_37) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_19) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Stern</m_str> (9_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>Isaac Stern</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Stern</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_31) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_15) 	<m_str>Mr. Stern</m_str> (16_12) 	<m_str>John Garfield</m_str> (16_25) 	<m_str>Mr. Stern 's</m_str> (16_33) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_23) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Isaac Stern in China</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (18_25) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_17) 	<m_str>the pianist Eugene Istomin</m_str> (19_21) 	<m_str>Eugene Istomin</m_str> (19_23) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the cellist</m_str> (19_26) 	<m_str>the cellist Yo-Yo Ma</m_str> (20_11) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>Carnegie Hall</m_str> (3_4) 	<br><blue>8(4)</blue>: <m_str>the hall</m_str> (9_49) 	<m_str>the hall</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>the hall</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>the main concert hall</m_str> (12_4) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
