<blue>1</blue>Max Manus , a Norwegian resistance leader whose Oslo Gang sank so many German warships , blew up so many German planes and kept Norwegian spirits so high during the Nazi occupation in World War II that he became a national hero , died on Friday , The Associated Press reported . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 81 . <br><blue>3</blue>When it came time for the Norwegian government in exile to recruit and train saboteurs to harry German shipping , industry and 400,000 occupation troops , the officials could hardly have found a more willing or qualified candidate than Mr. Manus . <br><blue>4</blue>By age 25 he was a restless , quick-witted adventurer who had been everything from a seaman to a smuggler . <br><blue>5</blue>He served as a volunteer in Finland during the so-called winter war of 1939-40 with the Soviet Union . <br><blue>6</blue>After the surprise German invasion of Norway in April 1940 , Mr. Manus was spirited out of the country , arriving in England seven months later to begin a crash course with the Kompani Linge band of volunteers in sabotage , parachute jumping and disguise . <br><blue>7</blue>Once he and a countryman had parachuted safely into the countryside outside Oslo and been supplied with hundreds of pounds of explosives and other provisions in follow-up air drops , there was hardly a day that the Germans did not feel their sting . <br><blue>8</blue>Although his chief target was German shipping in the Oslo harbor , Mr. Manus , who sometimes spent days under stinking piers waiting for cargo ships to tie up and who claimed even a battleship among his prizes , blew up virtually any German military or industrial target he encountered , including more than 100 German warplanes . <br><blue>9</blue>Although his name was at the top of the wanted lists in the hands of the Nazi and collaborationist police , the Norwegian people were unified in opposition . <br><blue>10</blue>( The puppet Prime Minister Vidkun Quisling was made the butt of so many vicious jokes , for example , that his very name became synonymous with collaborationist perfidy ) . <br><blue>11</blue>As a result , Mr. Manus boldly walked the streets of Oslo with virtual impunity , knowing that if his disguise did not protect him , his many loyal friends would . <br><blue>12</blue>Still , he sometimes had to rely on himself . <br><blue>13</blue>Once , when he was wounded during a mission and sought treatment in a hospital , he had to crash through a window to escape the police . <br><blue>14</blue>In pursuit of his mission , Mr. Manus and his associates sometimes went to extraordinary lengths , using inflatable rafts and rubber swimming suits to reach their targets , for example , and even developing a canoe-borne torpedo . <br><blue>15</blue>In one of their most spectacular successes , Mr. Manus and two associates punched a hole through a concrete pier . <br><blue>16</blue>It was empty and only lightly guarded at the time , but swarmed with troops armed with machine guns after the arrival of the 17,000-ton transport ship Donau , which had operated in the North Sea for several years . <br><blue>17</blue>Then , as the guards shot at anything they saw floating near the ship , Mr. Manus and his team used the hole shielded by the pier elevator to drop down to the ice beneath the pier . <br><blue>18</blue>There they inflated a dinghy , broke through the ice and attached explosives with time-delay fuses to the hull . <br><blue>19</blue>The next day , Jan. 19 , 1945 , as the loaded ship got under way , it exploded and sank . <br><blue>20</blue>The Germans withdrew shortly thereafter and by May Mr. Manus was telling his tale to visiting journalists . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>his name</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>his
