<blue>1</blue>Gloria Foster , the distinguished stage actress who portrayed generations of African-American characters in plays like '' In White America '' and '' Having Our Say , '' died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 64 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was diabetes , said Clarence Williams 3rd , her former husband . <br><blue>4</blue>Born in Chicago and reared by her grandmother , Ms. Foster studied at the Goodman Theater School of Drama and made her professional debut in the County Theater at the University of Chicago . <br><blue>5</blue>In 1963 she moved to New York and walked into an open audition for Martin B. Duberman 's '' In White America , '' a dramatic overview of the black American experience from life aboard 18th-century slave ships to the 20th-century crusade for civil rights . <br><blue>6</blue>Soft-spoken and polite and with a Mona Lisa smile , Ms. Foster won her role over dozens of seasoned New York actresses . <br><blue>7</blue>She soon found herself onstage at the Sheridan Square Theater in Greenwich Village , portraying no fewer than 27 characters . <br><blue>8</blue>It was a performance that won her ample attention from New York critics and producers . <br><blue>9</blue>Writing in The New York Times , Howard Taubman called Ms. Foster '' the most moving of all '' the actors in the play . <br><blue>10</blue>He later wrote that she '' shook New York '' in that role . <br><blue>11</blue>In particular he cited her portrayal of the teenage black girl who was the first to integrate Central High in Little Rock , Ark . <br><blue>12</blue>Life magazine also singled out the scene , and later published a two-page spread on Ms. Foster . <br><blue>13</blue>She won an Obie Award for that performance , one of three she would receive . <br><blue>14</blue>Judith Rutherford James , who produced '' In White America , '' soon cast Ms. Foster again , in 1965 , this time as Medea at the Martinique Theater on West 32nd Street , an Off Broadway house that has since vanished . <br><blue>15</blue>That performance won Ms. Foster another Obie in addition to a Theater World Award , and officially established her as a formidable classical actress . <br><blue>16</blue>In later decades , Ms. Foster took on a range of classical roles , including Titania and Hippolyta in '' A Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' Andromache in '' The Trojan Women '' and the mother in '' Blood Wedding . '' <br><blue>17</blue>Many of these productions were produced under the auspices of the New York Shakespeare Festival , whose longtime producer , Joseph Papp , also cast Ms. Foster as modern-day characters , including Miss Molly Hoffenburg in Bill Gunn 's '' Forbidden City , '' for which she won a third Obie in 1989 . <br><blue>18</blue>Perhaps more than awards , however , Ms. Foster 's career was notable for the directorial talent that sought her out , including Andrei Serban , who chose her for his Clytemnestra in '' Agamemnon , '' in a 1977 production at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park , and Joseph Chaikin , who cast her as the central character in '' Trespassing , '' in 1982 . <br><blue>19</blue>Ms. Foster also worked in film and television , playing a supporting role in the movie '' Nothing but a Man '' ( 1964 ) . <br><blue>20</blue>Younger hipster audiences were later introduced to Ms. Foster in the 1999 hit '' The Matrix , '' in which she played the Oracle , a mystical seer who sends the movie 's hero ( played by Keanu Reeves ) on his reality-bending mission . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Keanu Reeves</m_str> (20_38) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_42) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>the mother in '' Blood Wedding</m_str> (16_36) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (6_20) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>New York '' in that role</m_str> (10_8) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>her role</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>that role</m_str> (10_12) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>The cause</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (8_1) 	<br><blue>6(31)</blue>: <m_str>Gloria Foster , the distinguished stage actress who portrayed generations of African-American characters in plays like '' In White America '' and '' Having Our Say</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>Ms. Foster</m_str> (4_10) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_22) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_3) 	<m_str>Ms. Foster</m_str> (6_11) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>herself</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_7) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>Ms. Foster</m_str> (12_16) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>Ms. Foster again</m_str> (14_15) 	<m_str>Ms. Foster</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_19) 	<m_str>Ms. Foster</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (17_47) 	<m_str>Ms. Foster as modern-day characters</m_str> (17_26) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_20) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_29) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_56) 	<m_str>Ms. Foster 's</m_str> (18_8) 	<m_str>Ms. Foster</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>to Ms. Foster in the 1999 hit</m_str> (20_7) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_21) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>Howard Taubman</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_3) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>White America</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>White America</m_str> (5_21) 	<m_str>White America</m_str> (14_9) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>Broadway</m_str> (14_37) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>the play</m_str> (9_23) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
