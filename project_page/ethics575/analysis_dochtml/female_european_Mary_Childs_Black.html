J. Gladstone , a friend . <br><blue>4</blue>Mrs. Black 's greatest contribution to American folk art scholarship was her identification of the unsigned paintings of known American 18th - and 19th-century artists , attributions she based largely on social history . <br><blue>5</blue>Mrs. Black organized more than 100 exhibitions seen in the United States , Britain or Israel . <br><blue>6</blue>She made her most important discovery in the late 1960 's , when she identified portraits attributed to four unidentified painters as the work of one man , Ammi Phillips , an itinerant 19th-century artist born in Connecticut . <br><blue>7</blue>She disclosed her findings in 1969 in the book " Ammi Phillips , Portrait Painter , 1788-1865 , " which she wrote with Barbara and Lawrence Holdridge , folk art collectors . <br><blue>8</blue>The biography was published when she was director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City , where she had organized the first major show of Phillips 's work . <br><blue>9</blue>A Start at Williamsburg Her museum career began in 1956 when she was hired as a research assistant at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia . <br><blue>10</blue>Two years later she became curator at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center at Williamsburg , and was named director in 1961 . <br><blue>11</blue>She left Williamsburg in 1964 to become the director of the Museum of American Folk Art . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1969 she moved to the New-York Historical Society , where she remained as the curator of sculpture , painting and decorative arts until 1982 , when she was abruptly dismissed by the director , Dr. James B.
