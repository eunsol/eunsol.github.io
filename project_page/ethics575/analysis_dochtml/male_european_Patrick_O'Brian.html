<blue>1</blue>Patrick O'Brian , the Anglo-Irish novelist whose stirring tales of the British Navy in the Napoleonic Wars made him a literary celebrity at an age when most writers have long ceased to ply their trade , died in Dublin Sunday . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 85 . <br><blue>3</blue>In recent months Mr. O'Brian had acknowledged that he was in ill health and unlikely to continue his writing much longer . <br><blue>4</blue>His biographer , Dean King , said Mr. O'Brian 's body was being flown back to Collioure , the village near the Spanish border in the south of France where he had lived for almost half a century . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. O'Brian achieved international fame with his series of novels featuring Jack Aubrey , a British naval officer , and Stephen Maturin , an Irish-Catalan physician , naturalist and accomplished spy who was Aubrey 's friend and constant shipmate . <br><blue>6</blue>The first of the series , '' Master and Commander , '' appeared in 1969 ; the 20th , '' Blue at the Mizzen , '' was published late last year . <br><blue>7</blue>Like most of the Aubrey-Maturin novels , it appeared on the New York Times best-seller list . <br><blue>8</blue>When it first appeared , '' Master and Commander '' had modest success in England and Ireland . <br><blue>9</blue>A dozen more books in the series were produced over the next decade . <br><blue>10</blue>But it was n't until 1989 , when Starling Lawrence , who was to become his American editor , read one of the series , '' The Reverse of the Medal '' ( No. 11 ) , on a flight from London to New York that they were taken up by serious critics . <br><blue>11</blue>Mr. Lawrence 's company , W. W. Norton , began to publish the books in the United States , and within two years some 400,000 copies had been sold here . <br><blue>12</blue>To date , more than two million copies of the Aubrey-Maturin novels have been sold . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. O'Brian was compared to Melville and Conrad and even to Proust . <br><blue>14</blue>Iris Murdoch , the English novelist and scholar , was one of his first champions , and his admirers included Eudora Welty and Tom Stoppard . <br><blue>15</blue>Critics likened the O'Brian books to the sequential novels of Trollope and Anthony Powell , but Mr. O'Brian was particularly eager to be compared to Jane Austen . <br><blue>16</blue>He revered her as the finest of all English novelists and kept first editions of her works near him while wrote , along with first editions of Gibbon and Samuel Johnson and a battered but still serviceable 1810 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica . <br><blue>17</blue>The second book in the series , '' Post Captain , '' set mostly in country houses and as much a novel of manners as a sea story , was said to be Mr. O'Brian 's homage to Ms. Austen . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. O'Brian was something of a recluse . <br><blue>19</blue>Interviewers were warned away from personal questions , and while he was a paragon of politeness and 18th-century courtliness , he never hesitated to cut short any conversation he felt was edging toward his private life . '' <br><blue>20</blue>I very much dislike being interviewed by the kind of journalist who tries to dig into your private life , '' he once told a New York Times reporter . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Master and Commander</m_str> (6_8) 	<m_str>Master and Commander</m_str> (8_7) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (16_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_3) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>his private life</m_str> (19_34) 	<m_str>your private life</m_str> (20_17) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (1_34) 	<m_str>most writers</m_str> (1_27) 	<br><blue>5(5)</blue>: <m_str>the series</m_str> (9_6) 	<m_str>the series</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>the series</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>his series of novels</m_str> (5_7) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>Stephen Maturin , an Irish-Catalan physician , naturalist and accomplished spy who was Aubrey 's friend and constant shipmate</m_str> (5_21) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>Ireland</m_str> (8_17) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (10_42) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (10_44) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (10_47) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (10_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Lawrence 's</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>the books</m_str> (11_13) 	<m_str>books in the series</m_str> (9_4) 	<br><blue>12(28)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>O'Brian</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>Tom Stoppard</m_str> (14_24) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Brian</m_str> (15_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>Gibbon</m_str> (16_28) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Brian</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Brian</m_str> (3_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Brian 's</m_str> (17_34) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_18) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>His biographer , Dean King</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Brian 's</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_11) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Brian</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_7) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Brian</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_31) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_34) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_22) 	<m_str>Aubrey 's</m_str> (5_34) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_13) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>New York Times</m_str> (20_26) 	<m_str>New York Times</m_str> (7_12) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Aubrey-Maturin novels</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>the Aubrey-Maturin novels</m_str> (7_4) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (7_8) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
