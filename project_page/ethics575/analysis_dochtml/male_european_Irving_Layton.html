<blue>1</blue>Irving Layton , a Canadian poet as quirky as he was prolific , died on Jan. 4 in Montreal . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 93 . <br><blue>3</blue>The death was announced on his Web site , www.irvinglayton.com . <br><blue>4</blue>Press reports from Montreal said the cause was Alzheimer 's disease , diagnosed in 1994 . <br><blue>5</blue>Foreign-born , though barely so , Mr. Layton became a national celebrity with an oeuvre of more than 40 volumes of verse and prose dating to the mid-1940 's . <br><blue>6</blue>He was both influential and controversial in Canada for decades . <br><blue>7</blue>Admired by nobody more than himself , he also had his admirers in Europe and Asia , particularly in Italy and Korea . <br><blue>8</blue>In the United States his following was mainly confined to niches , like the school of Black Mountain poets , a leading forum of experimental verse , to whom he became a mentor . <br><blue>9</blue>These poets , including Robert Creeley , could respond to Mr. Layton 's idiosyncratic approach and use it in their innovative yet disciplined verse forms . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Layton was named to the Order of Canada in 1976 , his country 's highest honor . <br><blue>11</blue>Abrasive by nature , living an often flamboyantly unruly existence and seemingly enjoying his rambunctious reputation , he poured out verse that could be gritty , satirical , belligerent , acerbic or erotic . <br><blue>12</blue>He described himself as '' a quiet madman , never far from tears . '' <br><blue>13</blue>Others thought of him as the combined Picasso and Mae West of Canadian poetry . <br><blue>14</blue>His air of self-importance and misogynous undertones put off some readers and may have contributed to his relative obscurity in the United States . <br><blue>15</blue>But critics generally recognized him as a unique and earthy presence in Canadian letters who managed to bring poetry into contemporary affairs , and vice versa . <br><blue>16</blue>Irving Peter Lazarovitch -- a surname later changed -- was born in a small town in Romania and taken to Canada as an infant ; the family eventually settled in Montreal . <br><blue>17</blue>His first poem , dedicated to a teacher , was written in the sixth grade and included in a collection of love poetry published in 1986 , '' Dance With Desire . '' <br><blue>18</blue>He graduated from Macdonald College in 1939 and , after serving in the Canadian Army artillery in World War II , received a master 's degree from McGill University in 1946 . <br><blue>19</blue>His first published volume of poetry was '' Here and Now '' in 1945 . <br><blue>20</blue>Subsequent volumes in the 1950 's defined his voice as a literary figure , as did his voluminous correspondence with Creeley and the Canadian writers Cid Corman and Jonathan Williams . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (14_21) 	<m_str>the United States</m_str> (8_2) 	<br><blue>2(23)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_8) 	<m_str>Foreign-born , though barely so , Mr. Layton</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Layton 's</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_30) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Layton</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_13) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (7_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_17) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>Black Mountain poets , a leading forum of experimental verse</m_str> (8_17) 	<m_str>These poets , including Robert Creeley</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (9_20) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_10) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Canada</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>Canada</m_str> (6_8) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>Montreal</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>Montreal</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>Montreal</m_str> (16_31) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
