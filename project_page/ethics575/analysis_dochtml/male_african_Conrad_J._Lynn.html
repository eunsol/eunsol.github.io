<blue>1</blue>Conrad J. Lynn , a longtime civil rights lawyer whose clients included freedom riders in the South , Vietnam War draft resisters and Puerto Rican nationalists , died on Thursday at his home in Pomona , N.Y . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 87 . <br><blue>3</blue>During a six-decade law career , Mr. Lynn espoused scores of unpopular causes , leading the State Department to seize his passport in 1968 after he traveled to North Vietnam . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Lynn was born in Newport , R.I. , the second son of a domestic worker and a laborer who migrated from Georgia . <br><blue>5</blue>His family moved to Rockville Centre , L.I. , when he was a boy . <br><blue>6</blue>In 1932 Mr. Lynn became the first black graduate of Syracuse University Law School . <br><blue>7</blue>A member of the Communist Party in the late 1920 's and 1930 's , Mr. Lynn was expelled from the party in 1939 for supporting striking Trinidadian oil workers in their fight against Britain . <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Lynn participated in some of the earliest freedom rides in the 1940 's , when interracial groups of civil rights advocates rode buses to the South to protest Jim Crow laws . <br><blue>9</blue>In the early 1940 's , Mr. Lynn defended his brother Winfred , who had refused to be drafted into the United States Army in protest of its segregationist policies . <br><blue>10</blue>He took the case despite the concerns of mainstream civil rights groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , which felt that blacks would profit more by supporting the war effort . <br><blue>11</blue>Mr. Lynn also had a longstanding association with the Puerto Rican " independentistas , " who wanted their island to be free of United States rule . <br><blue>12</blue>In the early 1950 's , Mr. Lynn was the lawyer for one of the five Puerto Rican nationalists charged with shooting at members of Congress while they were in session . <br><blue>13</blue>They were convicted . <br><blue>14</blue>In what became known as the " Kissing Case , " Mr. Lynn represented two young black boys from North Carolina , age 7 and 9 , who were charged with rape because they had kissed a young white girl while they were playing house . <br><blue>15</blue>The boys , who were held for months without bail , were eventually released after supporters , including Eleanor Roosevelt , led an international campaign on their behalf . <br><blue>16</blue>In the 1960 's , Mr. Lynn defended many draft resisters who refused to fight in Vietnam . <br><blue>17</blue>One of those cases reached the United States Supreme Court . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Lynn argued unsuccessfully that conscientious objector status should be given to those who resist fighting in a particular war , but not necessarily all wars . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Lynn also defended many black activists of that era , including H. Rap Brown , a member of the Black Panther Party . <br><blue>20</blue>While defending many unpopular cases , Mr. Lynn sought to make blacks an integral part of the judicial system . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Communist Party in the late 1920 's and 1930 's</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>the party in 1939</m_str> (7_21) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>1940 's</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>1940 's</m_str> (9_4) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>striking Trinidadian oil workers</m_str> (7_27) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (7_32) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the United States Army</m_str> (9_21) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (9_28) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>two young black boys</m_str> (14_15) 	<m_str>The boys , who were held for months without bail</m_str> (15_1) 	<br><blue>6(21)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_32) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_26) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (6_3) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (7_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (12_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (14_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynn</m_str> (20_7) 	<br><blue>7(6)</blue>: <m_str>members of Congress</m_str> (12_24) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (12_28) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (14_34) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (14_42) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (15_27) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Vietnam</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>Vietnam</m_str> (16_17) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
