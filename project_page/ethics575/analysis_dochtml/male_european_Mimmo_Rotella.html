<blue>1</blue>Mimmo Rotella , the Italian artist who was one of the last surviving members of the influential French Nouveaux Réalistes group , died on Sunday in Milan . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 87 . <br><blue>3</blue>His death followed several months of illness , said his wife , Inna Rotella . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Rotella was best known for collages -- or , as he called them , décollages -- made from old and weathered posters that he stripped off outdoor walls in Rome . <br><blue>5</blue>He began producing those works in the early 1950 's , not realizing that at least two other artists , the Frenchmen Raymond Hains and Jacque Villeglé , had already started to produce similar works collaboratively . <br><blue>6</blue>Unlike those artists , who exhibited their torn and layered posters as they came off the wall without alteration , Mr. Rotella applied his appropriated materials to canvases and then developed the compositions further by tearing off pieces . <br><blue>7</blue>All three artists , as well as a fourth , François Dufrêne , became known as Les Affichistes . <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Rotella 's earlier compositions were primarily abstract , but in the early 1960 's he began to feature images of movie stars and consumer goods . <br><blue>9</blue>He also began to experiment with photographic and other processes of reproduction , and he produced three-dimensional assemblages as well , but his work would always revolve around mass media imagery . <br><blue>10</blue>In 1960 , the French critic Pierre Restany invited Mr. Rotella to join the Nouveax Réalistes , a group that included the other Affichistes as well as Yves Klein , Arman , Jean Tinguely , Daniel Spoerri and others who incorporated real-world materials into their art and thereby laid the foundations for French Pop Art . <br><blue>11</blue>Domenico Rotella was born Oct. 7 , 1918 , in Catanzaro in the Calabria region of Italy . <br><blue>12</blue>His mother was a well-known milliner . <br><blue>13</blue>He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples and trained and served reluctantly as a noncommissioned officer in a horse-drawn artillery regiment in World War II . <br><blue>14</blue>Living in Rome after the war , Mr. Rotella devoted himself to painting and in 1951 had his first solo exhibition , a display of abstract , geometric paintings , at Gallery Chiurazzi in Rome . <br><blue>15</blue>Mr. Rotella spent the year from 1951 to 1952 at the University of Kansas City in Missouri , on a Fulbright grant . <br><blue>16</blue>He had his second solo exhibition at the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery in Kansas City in 1952 . <br><blue>17</blue>In addition to painting , he continued to practice a form of experimental , purely phonetic poetry that he had developed and that he called by the nonsense term '' epistaltic '' poetry . <br><blue>18</blue>He made a record of his poetry and gave a performance at Harvard University . <br><blue>19</blue>When he returned to Rome he came to the conclusion that there was nothing left to do in painting , and he shortly thereafter discovered the materials and processes of décollage . <br><blue>20</blue>During the early 60 's , Mr. Rotella was included in many Nouveax Réalistes exhibitions throughout Europe , and in 1964 he was the Italian representative to the Venice Biennale . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>:
