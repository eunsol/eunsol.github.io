<blue>1</blue>Ba Jin , one of China 's most acclaimed writers and the author of several influential prerevolutionary novels about the brutality of Chinese feudal family life , died on Monday after a long hospitalization . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 100 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , Xinhua , the official Chinese news agency , said in its announcement . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Ba was widely considered a literary giant in China , a novelist who had inspired generations of writers and whose fame many here said should long ago have earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature . <br><blue>5</blue>With dozens of novels , essays , short stories and translations , Mr. Ba established himself decades ago as one of China 's greatest modern writers . <br><blue>6</blue>Along with Lu Xun , Mao Dun and Lao She , he helped describe and define modern China 's awakening and upheaval early in the 20th century . <br><blue>7</blue>He achieved fame early , in 1931 , with what is regarded as his masterpiece , '' Family , '' a brutal portrayal of a large feudal family 's disintegration and demise around the turn of the 20th century . <br><blue>8</blue>Semi-autobiographical , the novel alluded to the suicide of his own older brother , couching him as a victim of the decadent feudal family system . <br><blue>9</blue>It denounced that system of patriarchal control even as it warmly related family gatherings , literary diversions and festivities . <br><blue>10</blue>The family 's younger generation rebelled in a quest for personal and social renewal . <br><blue>11</blue>Several other novels and short stories written in the 1930 's and 1940 's helped cement his reputation as a great writer capable of describing family and societal ills in pre-revolutionary China ; he won plaudits from the Communists in the 1950 's . <br><blue>12</blue>But he was persecuted by his own government during the Cultural Revolution , the roughly decade-long period that ended in 1976 , in which intellectuals were publicly humiliated and millions of ordinary people and high-level party officials were denounced and sent to labor in the countryside . <br><blue>13</blue>Later , however , he was recognized as one of the nation 's literary lions . <br><blue>14</blue>He was even honored in recent years with a museum about his life in his hometown in western China . <br><blue>15</blue>Two years ago , Wen Jiabao , now the country 's premier , paid a visit to Mr. Ba in the hospital where he spent most of the last years of his life , suffering from Parkinson 's disease and unable to speak or walk . <br><blue>16</blue>He was born Li Yaotang on Nov. 25 , 1904 , in Chengdu , to a large wealthy family that he later said existed under a cruel , feudal system that suffocated and poisoned the lives of everyone in the family . <br><blue>17</blue>After growing up with private tutors and receiving a traditional , literary education , he left home to study and travel . <br><blue>18</blue>He later said he was inspired by the May 4 movement of 1919 , when students and intellectuals demonstrated and protested the West 's harsh treatment and rule over China . <br><blue>19</blue>Soon , he gravitated toward socialist and anarchist writings , and changed his name , to Ba Jin , which was said to have been derived from the names of two of his favorite Russian anarchists , Mikhail Bakunin and Pyotr Kropotkin . <br><blue>20</blue>( Xinhua , however , said it came from a friend who committed suicide because he detested the world . ) <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (9_10) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (9_1) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>western China</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>the country 's</m_str> (15_9) 	<br><blue>3(11)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (4_31) 	<m_str>Mr. Ba</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Ba</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>Mao Dun</m_str> (6_6) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Xinhua , however</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (20_7) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>a large feudal family 's</m_str> (7_25) 	<m_str>the family</m_str> (16_40) 	<m_str>The family 's</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Communists</m_str> (11_38) 	<m_str>the 1950 's</m_str> (11_41) 	<m_str>the nation 's</m_str> (13_11) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (3_16) 	<m_str>Xinhua , the official Chinese news agency</m_str> (3_6) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the 20th century</m_str> (6_25) 	<m_str>the 20th century</m_str> (7_37) 	<br><blue>9(20)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_34) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_32) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_33) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_21) 	<m_str>Mikhail Bakunin</m_str> (19_38) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_15) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>his life</m_str> (15_32) 	<m_str>his life in his hometown in western China</m_str> (14_12) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>China 's most acclaimed writers</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>China 's greatest modern writers</m_str> (5_22) 	<br><blue>12(6)</blue>: <m_str>China</m_str> (18_30) 	<m_str>China 's</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>China 's</m_str> (6_18) 	<m_str>China 's</m_str> (5_22) 	<m_str>China</m_str> (11_32) 	<m_str>China</m_str> (4_10) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
