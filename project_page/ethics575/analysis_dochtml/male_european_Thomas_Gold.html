<blue>1</blue>Dr. Thomas Gold , an astrophysicist at Cornell University whose wide-ranging work touched on lunar exploration , the origins of oil and the creation of the universe , often in the face of accepted theories , died on Tuesday at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca , N.Y . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 84 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was complications from heart disease , his daughter Lauren said . <br><blue>4</blue>Dr. Gold is credited with a stream of elegant and sometimes unconventional ideas that his peers acknowledged for their daring , without always accepting them . <br><blue>5</blue>He was best known for a 1968 paper on pulsars , which are rapidly spinning neutron stars surrounded by a large magnetic field that emit regular pulses of radio waves . <br><blue>6</blue>At the time , pulsars had been detected by radio telescopes , but had not been explained . <br><blue>7</blue>In 1948 , Dr. Gold , with Fred Hoyle and Hermann Bondi , proposed a new theory about the creation of the universe , which they named the steady-state theory of cosmology . <br><blue>8</blue>It held that the universe has remained constant and infinite , with a continuous creation of new matter . <br><blue>9</blue>When scientists subsequently found they could measure microwave radiation still lingering from the Big Bang of creation , the theory was discredited . '' <br><blue>10</blue>The steady-state theory was a beautiful idea and intellectually very nice , although the Big Bang has become the clear winner in science , '' said Dr. Peter Goldreich , an astrophysicist with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton who studied with Dr. Gold . <br><blue>11</blue>Dr. Gold had his most public role in the 1960 's , when he advised NASA during its Apollo lunar expeditions . <br><blue>12</blue>As a member of the space science panel of the President 's Science Advisory Committee , he correctly predicted that the moon 's surface would be powdery , probably pulverized by legions of strikes by asteroids and comets . <br><blue>13</blue>But a colleague from Cornell , Dr. Joseph Veverka , noted that Dr. Gold had miscalculated the depth of the lunar dust , initially suggesting that astronauts and their vehicles might sink beneath it . <br><blue>14</blue>Dr. Gold weighed in against using the space shuttle and other manned space flights in the 1980 's , arguing that instruments and unmanned flights could accomplish nearly as much for science . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Failures of unmanned launches ( and there will be some ) will cost money , but will not risk human lives , nor the prestige of the United States , '' he wrote in 1987 . '' <br><blue>16</blue>Nor will they subject the entire program to years of uncertainty and delay . '' <br><blue>17</blue>Late in his career , Dr. Gold returned to studies of Earth , and he pursued yet another unconventional theory about the origins of oil and methane . <br><blue>18</blue>His idea was that oil and other hydrocarbons are being constantly generated by a microbial process and are not chiefly the result of decaying organic plant matter . <br><blue>19</blue>He advanced his ideas in the book '' The Deep Hot Biosphere '' ( 1999 ) , and proposed that space programs begin to search for subterranean life , drilling for living microbes on Mars and other planets . <br><blue>20</blue>He also suggested that drilling deeply on Earth would resolve shortages in energy supply , an idea that has been openly contested by geologists . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>NASA</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (11_18) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (15_27) 	<br><blue>3(22)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>his daughter Lauren</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>Dr. Gold</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_15) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Gold , with Fred Hoyle and Hermann Bondi</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>Dr. Gold</m_str> (10_44) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_14) 	<m_str>Dr. Gold</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_17) 	<m_str>Dr. Gold</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>Dr. Gold</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_32) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>Dr. Gold</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Earth</m_str> (17_12) 	<m_str>Earth</m_str> (20_8) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>his peers</m_str> (4_15) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (4_19) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (4_25) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the depth of the lunar dust</m_str> (13_17) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (13_34) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Fred Hoyle and Hermann Bondi</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (7_26) 	<br><blue>8(4)</blue>: <m_str>the steady-state theory of cosmology</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>a new theory</m_str> (7_15) 	<m_str>the theory</m_str> (9_19) 	<m_str>The steady-state theory</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>the creation of the universe , which they named the steady-state theory of cosmology</m_str> (7_19) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (8_1) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the universe</m_str> (1_26) 	<m_str>the universe</m_str> (8_4) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>scientists</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (9_5) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
