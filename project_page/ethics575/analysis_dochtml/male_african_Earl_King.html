<blue>1</blue>Earl King , the New Orleans rhythm-and-blues guitarist and singer who wrote songs that became Mardi Gras standards , died on Thursday in New Orleans , his lawyer said . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 69 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was complications related to diabetes , according to the lawyer , Greg Eveline . <br><blue>4</blue>. <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. King , who lived in New Orleans , was a flamboyant performer , singing with bluesy ease and playing guitar solos that curled and sliced across the rolling New Orleans beat . <br><blue>6</blue>He recorded hundreds of songs that were rooted in both the 12-bar blues and New Orleans lore , with lyrics that could tell wry , compressed stories or come up with wild-eyed imagery . '' <br><blue>7</blue>Whatever gymnastics jump through my head , I write about it , '' he once said . <br><blue>8</blue>While Mr. King performed widely , his songs also traveled by way of other musicians : Jimi Hendrix , who recorded Mr. King 's '' Come On '' as '' Let the Good Times Roll '' on '' Electric Ladyland '' ; the Meters and Robert Palmer , who recorded Mr. King 's '' Trick Bag ; '' and Professor Longhair , who played piano and had the performer credit on the original 1964 version of Mr. King 's '' Big Chief , '' although it featured Mr. King 's vocals and whistling . <br><blue>9</blue>The Professor Longhair recording and remakes of '' Big Chief '' by performers including Allen Toussaint and Dr. John are still heard every year at Mardi Gras time . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. King was born Earl Silas Johnson IV in New Orleans in 1934 . <br><blue>11</blue>He started performing as a gospel singer , but then turned to the blues , at first singing with the band led by Huey ( Piano ) Smith . <br><blue>12</blue>He made his first single as Earl Johnson in the early 1950 's , playing guitar in a style strongly influenced by Guitar Slim ( Eddie Jones ) . <br><blue>13</blue>When he signed to Specialty Records , the label 's owner , Art Rupe , convinced him to bill himself as King Earl , but the typesetter reversed the names . <br><blue>14</blue>As Earl King he had a regional hit , '' A Mother 's Love , '' and then , after he moved to Ace Records , a national one with '' Those Lonely , Lonely Nights , '' which sold a reported 250,000 copies . <br><blue>15</blue>His own recording of '' Trick Bag '' was a Top 20 rhythm-and-blues hit in 1962 . <br><blue>16</blue>Mr. King was signed to Motown Records in the early 1960 's , but Motown never released any of his recordings . <br><blue>17</blue>Back in New Orleans , he revived the career of Professor Longhair , a revered New Orleans pianist , with '' Big Chief '' in 1964 , and his songs were also recorded by other New Orleans musicians including Lee Dorsey , Fats Domino and the Dixie Cups . <br><blue>18</blue>Hendrix recorded '' Let the Good Times Roll '' for the 1968 '' Electric Ladyland , '' which provided significant royalties through the years for Mr. King ; Stevie Ray Vaughan also recorded the song . <br><blue>19</blue>During the 1980 's and 90 's , Mr. King made albums for Black Top Records , including a 1986 collaboration with the band Roomful of Blues , '' Glazed , '' which was named because he made a Tastee Donuts shop his regular office and hangout . '' <br><blue>20</blue>Glazed '' was nominated for a Grammy Award . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>my</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (7_8) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>my head</m_str> (7_5) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Earl Silas Johnson</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>Earl Johnson</m_str> (12_7) 	<br><blue>4(9)</blue>: <m_str>New Orleans</m_str> (1_5) 	<m_str>New Orleans</m_str> (1_24) 	<m_str>the rolling New Orleans</m_str> (5_28) 	<m_str>New Orleans</m_str> (5_7) 	<m_str>New Orleans</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>New Orleans</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>New Orleans</m_str> (17_16) 	<m_str>New Orleans</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>New Orleans</m_str> (17_36) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_27) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_14) 	<br><blue>6(25)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. King</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_7) 	<m_str>Mr. King 's</m_str> (8_77) 	<m_str>Mr. King 's</m_str> (8_22) 	<m_str>Mr. King 's</m_str> (8_88) 	<m_str>Mr. King 's</m_str> (8_51) 	<m_str>Mr. King</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (13_17) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (13_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_21) 	<m_str>Earl King</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>Mr. King</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_29) 	<m_str>Mr. King</m_str> (18_26) 	<m_str>Mr. King</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_37) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_43) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>his songs</m_str> (17_29) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
