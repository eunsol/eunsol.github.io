<blue>1</blue>Alan Kulwicki , the Wisconsin-born racing driver who won the 1992 Nascar championship , was killed Thursday night along with three other men aboard a private plane that crashed while attempting to land at the Tri-County Airport near Bristol , Tenn . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 38 and had been scheduled to compete in the Food City 500 in Bristol tomorrow . <br><blue>3</blue>There was no immediate explanation for the crash , which also claimed the lives of three employees of Hooters of America , the regional restaurant chain that sponsored Kulwicki 's campaign . <br><blue>4</blue>They were identified by the Atlanta-based company as Mark Brooks , 26 , the company 's sports marketing manager and the son of its chairman , Robert H. Brooks ; Dan Duncan , 44 , the director of sports management , and Charlie Campbell , 48 , the corporate pilot . <br><blue>5</blue>Kulwicki was Joe College in a good old boys ' sport , but a decade and a half after he left the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee with a degree in mechanical engineering , he proved he belonged among the best . <br><blue>6</blue>A Racing Background Last Nov. 15 in the final race of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing season , the Hooters 500 at the Atlanta Motor Speedway , Kulwicki was 30 points out of first place in the yearlong standing . <br><blue>7</blue>He did not win the stock-car race , but finished high enough to take the overall championship in the $ 1 million Winston Cup . <br><blue>8</blue>Kulwicki was the first owner-driver to win the title since the legendary Richard Petty did it in 1979 , and he was the first college graduate and the first driver born north of the Mason-Dixon line to win a Nascar championship . <br><blue>9</blue>He may not have grown up in a tradition of midnight moonshine runs and dusty rural tracks , but Kulwicki , who was born in the Milwaukee suburb of Greenfield , was born to race . <br><blue>10</blue>His father , Gerald , was a noted builder of race-car engines , and Kulwicki , who grew up with a fascination for engines , began his racing career on Go Kart tracks at the age of 13 . <br><blue>11</blue>No Financial Backing After graduation , he worked for two years as an engineer but continued racing , first as a hobby and later as a professional on the short tracks in the Midwest . <br><blue>12</blue>Then in 1985 , pursuing a lifelong dream , he moved to Charlotte , N.C. , and joined the Nascar circuit . <br><blue>13</blue>With no outside financial backing , he scraped by with a single car and a two-man crew . <br><blue>14</blue>In 1986 , he was named Nascar rookie of the year in 1986 and was offered a lucrative contract to drive for the famous Junior Johnson team . <br><blue>15</blue>But Kulwicki , a meticulous pefectionist who was always his own chief engineer and chief mechanic , decided to continue alone . <br><blue>16</blue>There followed many bleak seasons , some with a sponsor and some without , but by the time he signed with Hooters in 1991 he was recognized as one of the top drivers on the circuit . <br><blue>17</blue>Last Nov. 15 , after proving he was as good as the best , Kulwicki the outsider broke with another Winston Cup tradition by spinning his car around and taking his victory lap the wrong way around the track . <br><blue>18</blue>Kulwicki is survived by his father . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Milwaukee</m_str> (5_27) 	<m_str>Milwaukee</m_str> (9_27) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Nascar circuit</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>the circuit</m_str> (16_35) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>His father , Gerald</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his father</m_str> (18_5) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Last Nov. 15</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>Last Nov. 15</m_str> (17_1) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the title</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (8_16) 	<br><blue>6(29)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Kulwicki 's</m_str> (3_29) 	<m_str>Kulwicki</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_35) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_37) 	<m_str>Kulwicki</m_str> (6_31) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Kulwicki</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_21) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Kulwicki , who was born in the Milwaukee suburb of Greenfield</m_str> (9_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_27) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Kulwicki</m_str> (10_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>Kulwicki , a meticulous pefectionist who was always his own chief engineer and chief mechanic</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_31) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_7) 	<m_str>Kulwicki</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_26) 	<m_str>Kulwicki</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_5) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Winston Cup</m_str> (7_23) 	<m_str>Winston Cup</m_str> (17_21) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the company 's</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (4_24) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Bristol</m_str> (1_39) 	<m_str>Bristol</m_str> (2_16) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the 1992 Nascar championship</m_str> (1_10) 	<m_str>the overall championship</m_str> (7_15) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>1986</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>1986</m_str> (14_13) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
