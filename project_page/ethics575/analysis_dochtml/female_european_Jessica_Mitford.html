<blue>1</blue>Jessica Mitford , whose book " The American Way of Death " won her enormous popularity as an irreverent muckraker and witty polemicist , died yesterday at her home in Oakland , Calif . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 78 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , said her daughter , Constancia Romilly . <br><blue>4</blue>Over the more than three decades that she wrote nonfiction , Miss Mitford railed against those who tried to suppress dissent over the Vietnam War , against a prison system she found to be corrupt and brutalizing , and against a medical profession she thought was greedy and given to unnecessary procedures . <br><blue>5</blue>She even exposed the odd doings of her sisters . <br><blue>6</blue>But it was " The American Way of Death , " published in 1963 , that made the British-born Miss Mitford a formidable literary figure in her adopted country . <br><blue>7</blue>Near her death she was preparing a revision to be published next year by Alfred A. Knopf . <br><blue>8</blue>The thesis of the book , a scathing indictment of the American funeral industry , was that undertakers had " successfully turned the tables in recent years to perpetrate a huge , macabre and expensive practical joke on the American public . " <br><blue>9</blue>She explored the changing lexicon of death , in which undertakers had come to call themselves " funeral directors " and " morticians , " coffins had become " caskets , " and hearses had become " professional cars . " <br><blue>10</blue>In the new order , she said , flowers were " floral tributes " and corpses were always called " loved ones . " <br><blue>11</blue>One of the results of all this , she said , was that the cost of dying was rising faster than was the cost of living . <br><blue>12</blue>She told her readers unsettling things about their neighborhood undertakers , much to the dismay of the trade , and at the end of the book included a list of medical schools that might have good use for a dead body . <br><blue>13</blue>She felt strongly that someone 's mortal remains would be better off studied by medical students than transformed into a profit center for those in the business of marketing and planning funerals . <br><blue>14</blue>The New Yorker hailed the book as a " brilliant journalistic case against the whole funeral industry , " and the work led to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission . <br><blue>15</blue>But not everyone was pleased . <br><blue>16</blue>James B. Utt , then a Republican Congressman from California , a state known for its Pharaonic funerals and ornate cemeteries , denounced Miss Mitford as " pro-Communist , anti-American . " <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Utt said he suspected that profits from the book " no doubt will find their way into the coffers of the Communist Party , U.S.A. " Miss Mitford had been a Communist in the 1940 's , an experience chronicled in her memoirs , but had quit the party . <br><blue>18</blue>Jessica Mitford was born on Sept. 11 , 1917 , at Batsford Mansion in Gloucestershire , England , one of seven children and the youngest daughter born to Lord Redesdale ( David Mitford ) and Lady Redesdale , the former Sydney Bowles . <br><blue>19</blue>It was by any measure a family given to eccentricity . <br><blue>20</blue>One of Miss Mitford 's five sisters , Pamela , aspired as a child to be a horse . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>James B.
