<blue>1</blue>Geoffrey Dearmer , a poet of such abiding modesty that he had to live to a hundred to see himself lionized as one of England 's poetic voices of World War I , died on Sunday at his home at Birchington-on-Sea , on the Kentish coast . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 103 . <br><blue>3</blue>A onetime Government censor and BBC executive , Mr. Dearmer was living in obscure retirement three years ago when he was suddenly thrust into the limelight as an acclaimed poetic contemporary of such celebrated soldier poets as Robert Graves , Rupert Brooke , Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Dearmer 's two volumes of war poems had been well received when they were published in 1918 and 1923 , and one or two of his poems had been regularly reproduced in anthologies . <br><blue>5</blue>But he had been virtually forgotten until an admirer , preparing a biographical sketch for yet another anthology , called the BBC to find out the date of his death . <br><blue>6</blue>Told that Mr. Dearmer was alive enough to cash his pension checks , the admirer , Laurence Cotterell , visited Mr. Dearmer and arranged for the re-publication of many of his poems in a volume entitled '' A Pilgrim 's Song : Selected Poems . '' <br><blue>7</blue>Although that volume , too , was well received , Mr. Dearmer , typically , had his doubts : '' Did I really write that ? '' <br><blue>8</blue>he asked as he riffled through page proofs during an interview before publication . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Oh dear , it 's really quite bad . <br><blue>10</blue>The overwritten work of a young man using important words without justification . '' <br><blue>11</blue>Although few would rank him with Owen , widely considered the best of the Great War poets , critics gave Mr. Dearmer his due . <br><blue>12</blue>In a review of his first volume in The New York Times in 1918 , for example , the critic Robert McBride said that even in the most unassuming of his verses , '' there is dignity that approaches grandeur . '' <br><blue>13</blue>But while Brooke was known for his sentimental patriotism and Owen for his fiery denunciation of the war , Mr. Dearmer tended to maintain an optimism in the face of carnage . <br><blue>14</blue>That may have been due partly to his lifelong religious fervor and partly to the fact that he seems to have had somewhat of a better war than Brooke , who died of blood poisoning on the way to Gallipoli in 1915 , and Owen , who was killed by German machine-gun fire a week before the armistice in 1918 . <br><blue>15</blue>To hear Mr. Dearmer tell it , although he fought at both Gallipoli in Turkey and the Somme line in France , he saw little death and destruction and found the notorious trenches comfortable enough under the circumstances . <br><blue>16</blue>He stopped publishing poetry in 1923 , he said , simply because he was not making enough money at it . <br><blue>17</blue>His proudest literary achievement was indeed not his poetry , but the critical role he played as a member of a theatrical selection board in 1928 in producing R. C. Sherriff 's '' Journey 's End , '' widely regarded as one of the great plays of the war . <br><blue>18</blue>He later worked as a Government censor of plays until the post was abolished , much to his satisfaction . <br><blue>19</blue>From 1939 to 1959 he was the editor and occasional contributor to the BBC 's '' Children 's Hour , '' a program of such literate humor that as many adults as children were in its audience . <br><blue>20</blue>His was the third voice , after Uncle Dave and Uncle Mac , to say good night at the end of the program . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>a volume entitled ''</m_str> (6_34) 	<m_str>that volume</m_str> (7_2) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Gallipoli</m_str> (14_40) 	<m_str>both Gallipoli</m_str> (15_12) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Dearmer 's two volumes of war poems</m_str> (4_1) 	<br><blue>4(18)</blue>: <m_str>Brooke</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>Brooke</m_str> (14_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_23) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_13) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>BBC</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>the BBC</m_str> (5_21) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>1918</m_str> (12_14) 	<m_str>1918</m_str> (14_60) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the admirer , Laurence Cotterell</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>an admirer , preparing a biographical sketch for yet another anthology</m_str> (5_8) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>his poems</m_str> (4_27) 	<m_str>his poems</m_str> (6_31) 	<m_str>war poems</m_str> (4_7) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>the war</m_str> (17_48) 	<m_str>Great War</m_str> (11_15) 	<m_str>the war</m_str> (13_17) 	<br><blue>10(31)</blue>: <m_str>him</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>Owen</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Dearmer , typically , had his doubts :</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Dearmer</m_str> (15_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_31) 	<m_str>Mr. Dearmer 's</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Dearmer</m_str> (11_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_23) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_11) 	<m_str>Rupert Brooke</m_str> (3_41) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_27) 	<m_str>Siegfried Sassoon</m_str> (3_44) 	<m_str>the critic Robert McBride</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Wilfred Owen</m_str> (3_47) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (1_20) 	<m_str>Owen</m_str> (13_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Dearmer</m_str> (6_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_31) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_29) 	<m_str>Mr. Dearmer</m_str> (13_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_38) 	<m_str>Mr. Dearmer</m_str> (6_21) 	<m_str>Mr. Dearmer</m_str> (3_9) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
