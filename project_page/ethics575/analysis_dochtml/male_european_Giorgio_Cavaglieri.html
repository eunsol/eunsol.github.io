<blue>1</blue>Giorgio Cavaglieri , an architect who took his fascination with how buildings and cities change over time from his native Italy to New York , where he helped start and define the city 's preservation movement , died on Tuesday in Manhattan . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 95 . <br><blue>3</blue>His nephew Andrew Tesoro announced the death . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Cavaglieri designed airfields for Mussolini 's army ; worked with Rosario Candela , the renowned designer of luxury Manhattan apartment buildings ; and won many awards . <br><blue>5</blue>But his best-known work is probably the Jefferson Market Library in Greenwich Village , which he restored in the mid-1960s . <br><blue>6</blue>That building was saved after preservationists had been unable to stop the demolition of Penn Station , and the project is generally regarded as the first real instance of successful historic preservation in New York City . <br><blue>7</blue>The battle to convert what had been a courthouse , considered the city 's premier High Victorian Gothic building , was led by Margot Gayle and other preservationists . <br><blue>8</blue>But it was Mr. Cavaglieri 's work to restore -- he used the word refresh -- the building that made the dream reality . <br><blue>9</blue>He began with four years of preliminary study , then integrated modern library facilities , like air-conditioning , elevators and furniture , into the turreted Victorian fantasy . <br><blue>10</blue>He carefully differentiated old details and new ones . <br><blue>11</blue>He took countless photos to ensure accuracy in replacing a stained-glass window and carved black walnut doors . <br><blue>12</blue>But features he designed as new -- rather than copied -- were contemporary in material and style . <br><blue>13</blue>The new entrance to the old circular stair tower , for instance , was through a sleek glass door set into the old carved limestone . <br><blue>14</blue>The most striking addition was a stark catwalk above the main reading room . <br><blue>15</blue>During the time he was working on the Jefferson Market building , Mr. Cavaglieri also altered the old Astor Library at 425 Lafayette Street into Joseph Papp 's Public Theater . <br><blue>16</blue>He opposed freezing the past in time , and some of his solutions were innovative : his 1983 renovation of a row of town houses on Madison Avenue , for example , involved a dramatically stylish red granite front . <br><blue>17</blue>Christopher Gray , who writes the '' Streetscapes '' column in the Real Estate section of The New York Times , wrote that today 's preservationists would almost certainly see this as an insult to the original design . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Cavaglieri told Mr. Gray , '' I do n't think it would be wise or right to interpret the opinion of a dead man . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Tesoro , also an architect , said his uncle was inspired by the way buildings have gone through successive transformations over centuries in Italy and spoke of actually seeing layers of time as he strolled the streets of Rome . <br><blue>20</blue>The term he coined for this phenomenon -- adaptive reuse -- has become a watchword of many preservationists .
