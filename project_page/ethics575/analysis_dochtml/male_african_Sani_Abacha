         <h1>Sani Abacha, 54, a Beacon of Brutality In an Era When Brutality Was Standard </h1>

<blue>1</blue>Gen. Sani Abacha , who died yesterday at 54 , was the seventh Nigerian officer to come to power by force since the country gained independence from Britain in 1960 . <br><blue>2</blue>But even against this background , General Abacha established a distinctive record of brutal rule . <br><blue>3</blue>Nigerian human rights groups , clandestinely active in the country and openly critical in exile , have charged that more people were arrested in his five and a half years in power than in the five decades of British rule . <br><blue>4</blue>General Abacha regularly expressed his authority through fiat or intimidation , but rarely revealed much about himself , giving no interviews and keeping to his official mansion , known as Aso Rock . <br><blue>5</blue>He would arrive at his office late in the day and work through the night , staying aloof even from his own ministers and military advisers . <br><blue>6</blue>A 1995 article in The New York Times reported that '' journalists who have gotten too close to the subject of General Abacha 's personal life are often arrested . '' <br><blue>7</blue>And even in Nigerian circles , little was known about the dictator 's life beyond the terse entries in the public record . <br><blue>8</blue>But his face , always obscured by dark glasses , was seen throughout the country on billboards that proclaimed , '' Abacha is the Answer . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Public works projects were named for him or his wife , Maryam , with whom he had nine children . <br><blue>10</blue>He was born on Sept. 20 , 1943 , in Kano State in the northern Muslim area that has produced most of the country 's leaders . <br><blue>11</blue>He attended school in Kano and just after independence was admitted to the Nigerian Military Training College in the northern city of Kaduna . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1963 he received his commission as a second lieutenant after studying at the Mons Defense Officers ' Cadet Training College in Aldershot , England . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1967 , when mostly Ibo forces tried to wrench their region and its oil riches out of a federated Nigeria and gain independence as Biafra , the young officer fought in the civil war , and the secessionists were defeated . <br><blue>14</blue>After the war , he continued his military training in England and then in Monterey , Calif . <br><blue>15</blue>Though his superiors recommended in 1971 that he never be promoted above the rank of colonel because he was '' not considered stable enough for higher command , '' he nonetheless rose steadily . <br><blue>16</blue>He was made a brigadier in 1980 , a major general in 1984 and a lieutenant general in 1987 . <br><blue>17</blue>He was also involving himself in political affairs . <br><blue>18</blue>As oil , the country 's main source of revenue , fell in price in the early 80 's , President Shehu Shagari , who was elected in 1979 , was toppled by the military on Dec. 31 , 1983 . <br><blue>19</blue>It was the first of three coups in which General Abacha had a leading role , this time collaborating with Gen. Ibrahim Babangida . <br><blue>20</blue>The plotters installed Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari as leader . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Gen.
