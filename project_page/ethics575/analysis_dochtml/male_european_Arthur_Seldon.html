<blue>1</blue>Arthur Seldon , a libertarian economist whose books , pamphlets and articles supplied much of the intellectual artillery that inspired Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's free-market revolution , died Tuesday at his home in Godden Green in Kent County , England . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 89 . <br><blue>3</blue>His death was confirmed by the Institute of Economic Affairs , the research group he helped found and guide . <br><blue>4</blue>Long before Mrs. Thatcher came to power in 1979 and attacked many decades of ever-increasing government power through privatization and her other free-market policies , intellectuals on the right were formulating novel approaches to education , health and other government services . <br><blue>5</blue>So initially radical were their notions that The Independent , a London newspaper , said this week that they were regarded as '' political crackpots . '' <br><blue>6</blue>The institute , known by its acronym , I.E.A. , '' plowed a lonely furrow in its espousal of capitalist ideas , '' according to Patrick Cosgrave in '' Thatcher : The First Term . '' <br><blue>7</blue>Mrs. Thatcher was listening , and regularly lunched at the institute before becoming prime minister , drinking in their message that users , not taxpayers , should pay for government services . <br><blue>8</blue>Tony Blair , the current Labor Party prime minister , continued much of Mrs. Thatcher 's free-market emphasis . <br><blue>9</blue>She thanked the '' lonely '' academics on the 30th anniversary of the institute in 1987 , saying , '' They were right and they saved Britain . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Seldon and Ralph Harris , now Lord Harris , the other founder of the I.E.A. , steered clear of partisan politics , being careful to portray their thoughts as a product of classical liberal economics . <br><blue>11</blue>They and their colleagues remained strictly outside of government , unlike many of the conservative research groups whose legions streamed into the administrations of President Reagan and subsequent Republicans . <br><blue>12</blue>They were not even necessarily members of Mrs. Thatcher 's Conservative Party . <br><blue>13</blue>Nor were some of their many ideas for transforming the British welfare state , particularly government vouchers to pay for private schooling , ultimately successful . <br><blue>14</blue>But the institute helped change the nature of Britain 's national conservation , as it also oversaw the proliferation of more than 100 similar institutions to nearly 80 countries . <br><blue>15</blue>This effort was greatly aided by Mr. Seldon 's ability to translate complex economic ideas into clear English . <br><blue>16</blue>He did this both as an editor of all the institute 's publications , more than 350 , and as the author of 28 books and some 230 articles . <br><blue>17</blue>His trenchant phrasemaking became famous , as in this criticism of socialist economies for providing less choice : '' Socialism is a vast machine for churning out piles of goods marked ' Take it or leave it . '' ' <br><blue>18</blue>Critics faulted Mr. Seldon as seeming to start with an ideological answer he liked and then looking around for a question . <br><blue>19</blue>In a review of Mr. Seldon 's 1990 book , '' Capitalism , '' Gordon Brown , a Labor Party leader who is now chancellor of the exchequer , suggested he made a theology out of free markets . <br><blue>20</blue>A letter to The Times of London in 1990 attacked Mr. Seldon 's contention that the spending decisions of people were truer indications of their wishes than elections . <br><hr><br><blue>1(7)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Seldon 's</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_13) 	<m_str>Mr. Seldon 's</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_31) 	<m_str>Mr. Seldon 's</m_str> (20_11) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>1990</m_str> (19_8) 	<m_str>1990</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the spending decisions of people</m_str> (20_16) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (20_25) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (5_19) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (5_5) 	<br><blue>5(8)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (9_25) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (9_21) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (10_28) 	<m_str>Mr. Seldon and Ralph Harris</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (11_3) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (13_5) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Britain</m_str> (9_27) 	<m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (14_9) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (17_34) 	<m_str>Socialism</m_str> (17_20) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (17_37) 	<br><blue>8(8)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (6_17) 	<m_str>The institute , known by its acronym , I.E.A.</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>the institute</m_str> (7_10) 	<m_str>the institute in 1987</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>the institute</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_15) 	<m_str>the institute 's</m_str> (16_10) 	<br><blue>9(11)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_32) 	<m_str>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's</m_str> (1_21) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_15) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Mrs. Thatcher</m_str> (4_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_21) 	<m_str>Mrs. Thatcher</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mrs. Thatcher 's</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Mrs. Thatcher 's</m_str> (12_8) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>Labor Party</m_str> (8_6) 	<m_str>Labor Party</m_str> (19_19) 	<br><blue>11(1)</blue>: <m_str>his home</m_str> (1_32) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
