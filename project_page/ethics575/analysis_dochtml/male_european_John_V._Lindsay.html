<blue>1</blue>John V. Lindsay , the debonair political irregular who represented Manhattan 's Silk Stocking district on the East Side for seven years in Congress and was a two-term mayor of New York during the racial unrest , antiwar protests , municipal strikes and other upheavals of the 1960 's and early 70 's , died late Tuesday night at Hilton Head Medical Center , near his home in Hilton Head , S.C . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 79 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was complications from pneumonia and Parkinson 's disease , said his daughter Katharine Lake . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Lindsay had been in failing health for years , suffering from Parkinson 's , heart trouble and the effects of two strokes that left his speech slurred and impaired his capacity to read and walk . <br><blue>5</blue>An athletic , buoyant man most of his life , Mr. Lindsay spent his final years in a vale of adversity . <br><blue>6</blue>Two law firms with which he was associated went out of business . <br><blue>7</blue>He underwent heart surgery and collapsed in public twice . <br><blue>8</blue>At times , he had no pension or health insurance . <br><blue>9</blue>The riches evoked by his patrician manner turned out to be illusory , and he and his wife , Mary , lived for years in a one-bedroom apartment . <br><blue>10</blue>But friends and old allies said he bore up with a dignity they remembered from his maverick Republican years in the House of Representatives from 1959 to 1965 , from his turbulent years as Republican-Liberal and Liberal-Fusion mayor from 1966 to 1973 , and from his fading years as a Democrat who fell far short of a presidential nomination in 1972 and a Senate nomination in 1980 . <br><blue>11</blue>With the hindsight of decades , historians and political experts have given the Lindsay mayoralty mixed reviews . <br><blue>12</blue>It was a tumultuous eight-year ride marked by strikes , racial divisions , fiscal problems and a profound alienation of the city 's white working and middle classes that only grew worse as the Lindsay stewardship went on , with effects still being felt by many today . <br><blue>13</blue>But it was also a remarkable era in which many New Yorkers took a new pride in their city and its urbane , matinee-idol mayor , who hobnobbed with movie stars and battled the bureaucracy , who took his star quality into the streets in shirt sleeves , at times picking up litter himself or berating Park Avenue doormen for letting limousines double-park , and who once strode into a bar to order dumbstruck sanitation workers back to their unattended trucks . <br><blue>14</blue>As New Yorkers of his day recall , he created a Kennedyesque excitement , bringing into city government bright young people of wit , zeal and imagination . <br><blue>15</blue>He insisted that the parks were for the people , not cars , and filled them with concerts and go-go dancing and kite-flying contests , psychedelic sidewalk painting and other '' happenings . '' <br><blue>16</blue>He promoted New York as Fun City , a cornucopia of theater , arts and other goings-on . <br><blue>17</blue>Unlike politicians who criticized antiwar protests and civil rights marches , he joined them . <br><blue>18</blue>And when riots tore at Detroit , Newark , Los Angeles and other cities , he walked the steamy night streets of Harlem and other black areas , tie askew , jacket flung over the shoulder , taller than anyone else , talking to people with only a detective at his side : a calm figure of civic dignity . <br><blue>19</blue>And while other cities burned , New York had only minimal looting and violence . <br><blue>20</blue>A Celebrity-Politician In New York and Nation Trailed everywhere by reporters and cameras in the nation 's media capital , featured in national magazines and on television network news programs , a familiar face on Johnny Carson 's television show , Mr. Lindsay became known to millions of Americans as a glamorous celebrity-politician battling New York 's iniquities in what he called '' the second toughest job in America .
