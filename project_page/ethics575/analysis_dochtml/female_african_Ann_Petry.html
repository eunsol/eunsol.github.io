<blue>1</blue>Ann Petry , who took a single stretch of Harlem and brought it vividly and disturbingly to life in her acclaimed 1946 novel , '' The Street , '' died on Monday at a convalescent center near her home in Old Saybrook , Conn . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 88 . <br><blue>3</blue>So much has been written about the hard life on the the mean streets of Harlem , it may seem surprising that the first major literary work to focus on that life would be a first novel by a woman who not only had not grown up there but whose exposure to Harlem street culture had been limited to nine months working with an experimental after-school program on West 116th Street . <br><blue>4</blue>But then Ann Lane Petry was a surprising woman , one of such enormous empathy and imaginative flair that she did not need to encounter many bereft latchkey children , their desperate , beleaguered mothers or the assortment of opportunistic men who preyed on them to translate her observations into literature . <br><blue>5</blue>Half a century after '' The Street , '' was first published by Houghton-Mifflin , Mrs. Petry 's creations , Ludie Johnson and her 8-year-old son Bub , are still regarded as among the more indelible characters of black literature . <br><blue>6</blue>One reason , perhaps , that Harlem street life had such a powerful impact on Mrs. Petry , was that it was so far removed from her own genteel upbringing . <br><blue>7</blue>A native of Old Saybrook , where her father , Peter Lane , had opened a pharmacy in 1902 , she grew up in one of the few black families in the white resort . <br><blue>8</blue>Several members of her mother 's family were pharmacists , too , and in time Mrs. Petry graduated from the College of Pharmacy at the University of Connecticut and went to work at her father 's store . <br><blue>9</blue>But ever since a high school teacher who did not like her had praised her work and said she could become a writer , she had been writing stories and , as she later put it , gathering rejection slips . <br><blue>10</blue>Her life began to change in 1938 when she married George Petry , a Louisiana-born resident of Harlem she had met while both were visiting friends in Hartford . <br><blue>11</blue>The couple settled in Harlem , and Mrs. Petry held a variety of jobs , including writing advertising copy for The Amsterdam News and working as a reporter and editor of the women 's pages of The People 's Voice , a weekly started by Adam Clayton Powell Jr . <br><blue>12</blue>When The Crisis , a magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , paid her $ 20 for one of her stories , '' On Saturday , the Sirens at Noon , '' it came to the attention of an editor at Houghton-Mifflin and led to both a $ 2,500 literary award and a contract for what became '' The Street . '' <br><blue>13</blue>Mrs. Petry , who had written the book while her husband was in the service in World War II , was not quite prepared for the stir it created when it was published to both critical and popular acclaim . <br><blue>14</blue>But '' The Street , '' which sold 1.5 million copies , gave Mrs. Petry the wherewithal to retreat back to Old Saybrook , where she and her husband settled in a 200-year-old sea captain 's house and got an unlisted telephone number . <br><blue>15</blue>She followed '' The Street , '' with two other novels , '' Country Place , '' ( 1947 ) about about a serviceman who returns from the war to discover his wife is having an affair , and '' The Narrows , '' ( 1953 ) about an interracial affair . <br><blue>16</blue>Neither enjoyed the critical or commercial success of her first novel , however , and from then on Mrs. Petry , by then a mother , turned out books for children and young adults , among them two biographies , '' Tituba of Salem Village , '' and '' Harriet Tubman : Conductor on the Underground Railroad . '' <br><blue>17</blue>She also brought out a collection of her short stories , '' Legends of the Saints , '' but after its publication in 1970 , she limited her output to articles for college journals and the like . <br><blue>18</blue>Mrs. Petry had to endure a fresh burst of fame in 1992 when '' The Street , '' was reissued in paperback to a new round of acclaim . <br><blue>19</blue>She is survived by her husband and a daughter , Elisabeth , of Cromwell , Conn . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>her work</m_str> (9_15) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (9_36) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>such a powerful impact on Mrs. Petry</m_str> (6_11) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (6_21) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (4_45) 	<m_str>their desperate , beleaguered mothers</m_str> (4_31) 	<br><blue>4(6)</blue>: <m_str>Ann Petry</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_20) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_38) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_48) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_20) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>her husband</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>her husband</m_str> (14_28) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>a single stretch of Harlem</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (1_13) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Old Saybrook , Conn.</m_str> (1_41) 	<m_str>Old Saybrook</m_str> (7_4) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>young adults</m_str> (16_33) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (16_37) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>The Street</m_str> (12_64) 	<m_str>The Street</m_str> (15_4) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (12_38) 	<m_str>Noon</m_str> (12_35) 	<br><blue>11(6)</blue>: <m_str>Harlem</m_str> (1_10) 	<m_str>Harlem</m_str> (3_16) 	<m_str>Harlem</m_str> (3_53) 	<m_str>Harlem</m_str> (6_7) 	<m_str>Harlem</m_str> (10_18) 	<m_str>Harlem</m_str> (11_5) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>Bub</m_str> (5_27) 	<m_str>Ludie Johnson</m_str> (5_21) 	<br><blue>13(36)</blue>: <m_str>Ann Lane Petry</m_str> (4_3) 	<m_str>Mrs. Petry 's</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_24) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_27) 	<m_str>Mrs. Petry</m_str> (6_16) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_21) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>Mrs. Petry</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_34) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_15) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_19) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_25) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_33) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_19) 	<m_str>Mrs. Petry</m_str> (11_8) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_25) 	<m_str>Mrs. Petry , who had written the book while her husband was in the service in World War II</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_26) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (14_28) 	<m_str>Mrs. Petry</m_str> (14_14) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_9) 	<m_str>Mrs. Petry</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (17_26) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_28) 	<m_str>Mrs. Petry</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_5) 	<br><blue>14(3)</blue>: <m_str>that life</m_str> (3_31) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (3_18) 	<m_str>the hard life on the the mean streets of Harlem</m_str> (3_7) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>her father , Peter Lane</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>her father 's</m_str> (8_34) 	<br><blue>16(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (13_28) 	<m_str>the service in World War II</m_str> (13_14) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (13_31) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
