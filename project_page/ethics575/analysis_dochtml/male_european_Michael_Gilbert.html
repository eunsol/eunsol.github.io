<blue>1</blue>Michael Gilbert , who somehow managed to produce dozens of intricately plotted and gracefully written detective stories , police procedural novels , espionage thrillers , puzzle mysteries and crime-based plays for stage , radio and television while carrying on a separate career as a senior partner in a firm of London solicitors , died on Feb. 8 at his home in Luddesdown , Kent . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 93 . <br><blue>3</blue>His death was confirmed by his former publisher Douglas Greene of Crippen &amp; Landru . <br><blue>4</blue>According to an article by the British author and critic H. R. F. Keating , who included Mr. Gilbert 's 1950 novel '' Smallbone Deceased '' ( whose plot he deemed '' in every way as good as those of Agatha Christie at her best '' ) in '' Crime &amp; Mystery : The 100 Best Books , '' Mr. Gilbert was still writing mysteries until a few years before he died . <br><blue>5</blue>Beginning in 1947 with the novel '' Close Quarters , '' Mr. Gilbert 's work was notable for its high literary style and meticulous plot construction , elements that put him in the category of those classical masters of what is often called the golden age of the British mystery -- Dorothy Sayers , Michael Innes and Cyril Hare among them -- who valued above all else a sturdy story with a daunting puzzle , layered with dense detail , multiple clues and schools of red herrings . <br><blue>6</blue>But Mr. Gilbert was hardly a slave to category . <br><blue>7</blue>Although he wrote a popular series featuring Patrick Petrella , an erudite detective who over several procedural novels worked his way up from lowly constable to detective chief inspector with Scotland Yard , Mr. Gilbert was quick to try out new sleuths and place them in a variety of fiction subgenres . <br><blue>8</blue>Two elderly counterintelligence agents , Daniel John Calder and Samuel Behrens , who figured in several short stories with espionage themes , exercised considerable skill at passing themselves off as harmless , even witless , country gentlemen . <br><blue>9</blue>The bluff Chief Inspector Hazelrigg was the protagonist of another popular series . <br><blue>10</blue>But Mr. Gilbert also pressed civilians , from art experts and government bureaucrats to the dean of a cathedral , into one-time service as amateur sleuths of his novels . '' <br><blue>11</blue>Smallbone Deceased , '' published in the United States by Harper &amp; Brothers , as was much of his other writing , is most often cited by critics as Mr. Gilbert 's most intricate and rewarding novel . <br><blue>12</blue>Set in a firm of London solicitors who work under the shingle of Horniman , Birley and Graine , the novel ingeniously cross-fertilizes the arcane workings of British law with the elaborate red herrings and blind clues of the traditional whodunit . <br><blue>13</blue>Many of Mr. Gilbert 's stories begin in law offices and turn on technical legal matters that sometimes make their way into trial scenes . <br><blue>14</blue>He himself wrote much of his work on his one-hour trip between home and office . <br><blue>15</blue>Given the author 's own legal background , it was no wonder that he took pleasure in mixing the high drama of the courtroom with the low farce afforded by suave lawyers and their unsavory clients . <br><blue>16</blue>Carolyn Heilbrun , the literary scholar who wrote academic mysteries under the name of Amanda Cross , saw something more enduring than a keen ( one might even say nit-picking ) legal mind behind Mr. Gilbert 's urbane mysteries , literary spy stories and harrowing thrillers . <br><blue>17</blue>In a 1982 review of '' Mr. Calder and Mr. Behrens '' and '' End-Game '' for The New York Times Book Review , Heilbrun characterized his entertaining fiction as '' what I think of as the English male romance , in which the ideals of boyhood and youth make one either gallant or a renegade . '' <br><blue>18</blue>Observing the '' male camaraderie '' of his sleuths , she saw his novels as repositories for '' the myths of friendship , loyalty , courage and unadvertised accomplishment . '' <br><blue>19</blue>The first editions of Mr. Gilbert 's last two books , both short story collections , were published by a small American house , Crippen &amp; Landru . '' <br><blue>20</blue>The Man Who Hated Banks and Other Mysteries '' came out in 1997 , and '' The Curious Conspiracy and Other Crimes '' was published in 2002 , for the author 's 90th birthday .
