         <h1>Helmut Gernsheim, 82, Historian of Photography </h1>

 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>Helmut Gernsheim , a one-time commercial photographer who helped create the academic study of the history of photography , became one of its most influential and prolific practitioners and assembled one of the most extensive private collections of early photographs , died on July 20 in Switzerland . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 82 and lived in Lugano , Switzerland . <br><blue>3</blue>When Mr. Gernsheim turned from taking pictures to studying the history of photography in London in 1945 , photography was not taken seriously as either art or acamemic study . <br><blue>4</blue>Although Beaumont Newhall had presented a groundbreaking exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1937 , there were still no galleries devoted to photography and no photographic auctions . <br><blue>5</blue>Over the next 25 years , Mr. Gernsheim and his first wife , Alison Eames , virtually created the field , carrying out extensive research in private libraries and dusty attics and writing both the syllabus and the texts used by later historians . <br><blue>6</blue>Their monumental works , " The History of Photography " ( 1955 ) and its derivative " A Concise History of Photography " ( 1965 ) , are still regarded as the authoritative reference works . <br><blue>7</blue>Their studies of individual 19th-century photographers from Joseph Nicephore Niepce and Louis Daguerre to Lewis Carroll set the standard for later scholars , and their photographic histories of Sir Winston Churchill , Queen Victoria and others extended their work to a popular audience . <br><blue>8</blue>A native of Munich , Germany , who trained as a photographer there before fleeing the Nazis , Mr. Gernsheim set up shop as a commercial photographer in London in 1937 . <br><blue>9</blue>After the outbreak of World War II he was interned as a " friendly enemy alien , " and transported to a bleak detention camp in Australia where he whiled away his time lecturing his fellow inmates on the esthetics of photography . <br><blue>10</blue>He won a return to London in 1942 by volunteering for a macabre assignment , making a photographic record of London landmarks that might be destroyed in the war . <br><blue>11</blue>Within months of his return he published a monograph based on his Australian lectures , in which he derided the " antiquated , fuzzy , sentimental , sugary work " that passed for photographic art in wartime London . <br><blue>12</blue>The monograph brought him to the attention of Mr. Newhall , by then the curator of the Museum of Modern Art 's new department of photography , and when Mr. Newhall went to London to visit him in 1944 , the meeting changed Mr. Gersheim 's life . <br><blue>13</blue>Arguing that British photography would reform itself without further intervention from Mr. Gernsheim , Mr. Newhall urged him instead to devote himself to collecting and preserving distinguished 19th-century images , which were in danger of being lost forever . <br><blue>14</blue>Taking the advice , the Gernsheims began collecting . <br><blue>15</blue>It was a measure of the low regard in which photography was held at the time that they quickly assembled some 6,000 photographs with virtually no outlay . <br><blue>16</blue>By far their most significant find was the discovery of a long-lost pewter print made by Niepce in France in 1826 or 1827 , more than a decade before the first daguerreotype in 1839 , which had long been considered the beginning of photography . <br><blue>17</blue>Although his extensive writings , including 26 books , and various exhibitions won critical praise and helped change attitudes toward photography , progress was slow . <br><blue>18</blue>That became apparent in 1961 , when Mr. Gernsheim , who had become a British citizen in 1946 and had long dreamed of finding a permanent home for his collection in Britain , showed his collection on television in what amounted to an infomercial seeking benefactors for a British photographic museum . <br><blue>19</blue>No British benefactors came forward , and two years later , the entire Gernsheim collection of some 50,000 images , 3,000 books and albums and 300 pieces of equipment was bought by the Harry Ramson Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas , which overnight became one of the world 's premier photographic repositories , rivaled only by the International Museum of Photography and Film in Rochester . <br><blue>20</blue>Although no price was disclosed , Mr. Gernsheim indicated he had received less than $ 500,000 , enough to pay for his retirement in Switzerland , but , the collection 's senior curator , Roy Flukinger , said that was only a small fraction of what it would have fetched a decade later when the market Mr. Gernsheim helped create came of age . <br><hr><br><blue>1(5)</blue>: <m_str>his collection in Britain</m_str> (18_29) 	<m_str>the collection 's</m_str> (20_29) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (20_47)
