<blue>1</blue>Gerard K. O'Neill , a professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University , died on Monday at the Sequoia Medical Center in Redwood , Calif . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 69 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>He died of complications from leukemia , said Betty Graeber , a spokeswoman for the Space Studies Institute that Dr. O'Neill co-founded in Princeton . <br><blue>4</blue>Dr. O'Neill first drew wide notice with his invention in 1956 of the storage ring principle for colliding particle beams , now the basis for most high-energy physics research . <br><blue>5</blue>But in later years his interests and ideas , while focused on using technology in more direct ways to advance humanity , grew broader . <br><blue>6</blue>By the late 1960 's he had become a leading advocate of space colonization , which he referred to as the " humanization " of space , and had begun to draft blueprints for self-supporting space habitats that could be powered by solar energy . <br><blue>7</blue>Writer and Entrepreneur He maintained that a " breakout " from Earth was " almost inevitable " and that it would ultimately be " the difference between success and failure for intelligent life , " a view he expanded upon in one of his four books , " The High Frontier . " <br><blue>8</blue>The book , published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1977 , was awarded the Phi Beta Kappa Science Book Award . <br><blue>9</blue>Dr. O'Neill also wrote " 2081 : A Hopeful View of the Human Future , " " The Technology Edge : Opportunities for America in World Competition , " and was co-author of a graduate-level textbook on elementary particle physics . <br><blue>10</blue>He was also an active entrepreneur , forming in the 1970 's and 1980 's a number of private nonprofit organizations and for-profit businesses . <br><blue>11</blue>All were geared toward technology development . <br><blue>12</blue>They included the Space Studies Institute , which he founded with his wife , Tasha Steffen , and which supports educational and research programs in space development , and the Geostar Corporation , which developed the first private satellite navigational system to guide travel on Earth . <br><blue>13</blue>Honors for Work in Science At the time of his death , Dr. O'Neill was working on a form of high-speed ground-based transportation , called a magnetic flight system , in which a small-diameter car would " float " on a magnetic force in a vacuum tube on land or underground , and thus be able to reach incredible land speeds that would make it possible to travel from Boston to Los Angeles in an hour . <br><blue>14</blue>Dr. O'Neill , a native of New York City who attended school in Newburgh , N.Y. , joined the Navy on his 17th birthday . <br><blue>15</blue>He received an honorable discharge in 1946 with the rank of radar technician II . <br><blue>16</blue>He then entered Swarthmore College , graduating Phi Beta Kappa in physics and mathematics in 1950 . <br><blue>17</blue>He earned a doctorate in physics from Cornell University in 1954 , and that year was offered a junior-faculty position at Princeton . <br><blue>18</blue>He was named a full professor in 1959 and retired from Princeton in 1985 . <br><blue>19</blue>His many honors included an honorary degree from Swarthmore College in 1978 , an appointment by President Reagan to the National Commission on Space in 1985 , and being named the Hunsaker Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1986 . <br><blue>20</blue>In addition to his wife , Dr. O'Neill is survived by two daughters , Janet , of Madison , Wis. , and Eleanor , of Medford , Ore. , and two sons , Edward , of Princeton , and Roger , of San Carlos , Calif . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>: <m_str>Princeton</m_str> (17_22) 	<m_str>Princeton</m_str> (20_37) 	<m_str>Princeton</m_str> (3_24) 	<m_str>Princeton</m_str> (18_12) 	<br><blue>2(19)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_44) 	<m_str>Dr. O'Neill</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>Dr. O'Neill</m_str> (3_20) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Dr. O'Neill</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>Dr. O'Neill , a native of New York City who attended school in Newburgh , N.Y.</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>Dr. O'Neill</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Dr. O'Neill</m_str> (20_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_38) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>a `` breakout '' from Earth</m_str> (7_7) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (7_20) 	<br><blue>4(7)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_22) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_4) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Earth</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>Earth</m_str> (12_46) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>All</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Swarthmore College</m_str> (16_4) 	<m_str>Swarthmore College</m_str> (19_9) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Science</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (13_65) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>1985</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>1985</m_str> (19_26) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
