<blue>1</blue>Douglas Adams , the whimsical British novelist who wrote '' The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , '' the best-selling science fiction humor series that introduced readers to a universe of preening , two-headed aliens , manic-depressive robots and space travelers who never parted with their bath towels , died on Friday in Santa Barbara , Calif . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 49 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was apparently a heart attack , said his personal assistant , Sophie Astin . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Adams , a fan of the British comedy series '' Monty Python '' and a former writer and editor for '' Doctor Who , '' the BBC 's long-running science fiction television show , seemed to combine the best of both in his '' Hitchhiker '' series , which began as a radio play in 1978 . <br><blue>5</blue>The story follows the adventures of a group of planet-hopping space travelers , joined by a British everyman named Arthur Dent , shortly after Earth is demolished to make way for an intergalactic superhighway . <br><blue>6</blue>A biting satire of technology , politics , science fiction , bureaucracy and , yes , travel guides , the radio play was turned into a book that sold 14 million copies around the world . <br><blue>7</blue>In 1982 , Mr. Adams became the first British author since Ian Fleming to have three books on the best-seller lists of both The New York Times and Publishers Weekly . <br><blue>8</blue>The books were later turned into a television series , a stage play , record albums , comic books and a video game . <br><blue>9</blue>The original book was also followed by several sequels , growing to a '' five-part trilogy , '' as Mr. Adams put it , including '' The Restaurant at the End of the Universe , '' '' Life , the Universe and Everything '' and '' So Long , and Thanks for All the Fish . '' <br><blue>10</blue>The series is widely considered a landmark for its clever and adroit blend of two genres , science fiction and comedy . <br><blue>11</blue>Aside from the small cottage industry of '' Hitchhiker '' spinoffs that resulted from the series , Mr. Adams 's influence can be seen in a range of science fiction works since , from the British television series '' Red Dwarf '' to the 1999 film '' Galaxy Quest . '' <br><blue>12</blue>Douglas Noel Adams was born in Cambridge , England . <br><blue>13</blue>He was educated at the Brentwood School in Essex and St. John 's College , Cambridge . <br><blue>14</blue>He said in 1982 that the idea for the series '' originally came to me 11 years ago , when I was about to go to Cambridge University and I was hitchhiking around in Europe . '' '' <br><blue>15</blue>I had a copy of a book called ' The Hitchhiker 's Guide to Europe , ' '' he continued , '' and one night I was lying in a field in Innsbruck -- I have to say that I was drunk -- and I was staring at the stars . <br><blue>16</blue>It was one of those beautiful starlit nights , and it occurred to me that at some point somebody should write a hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy as well . <br><blue>17</blue>I fell asleep and forgot about it for six years . '' <br><blue>18</blue>What resulted when he finally remembered was a playful tale of a rich collection of characters with memorable names like Zaphod Beeblebrox , Slartibartfast and Eccentrica Gallumbits . <br><blue>19</blue>The fictional guide itself was a galactic glossary of subjects that would prove useful to any space tourist , from the best recipe for a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster to the health risks associated with listening to Vogon poetry . <br><blue>20</blue>It also contained useful hints for the frugal interstellar traveler ( '' How to see the marvels of the universe for less that 30 Altairian dollars a day !
