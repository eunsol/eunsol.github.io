<blue>1</blue>Alice Coltrane , widow of the jazz saxophonist John Coltrane and the pianist in his later bands , who extended her musical searches into a vocation as a spiritual leader , died on Friday in Los Angeles . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 69 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was respiratory failure , said Marilyn McLeod , her sister and assistant . <br><blue>4</blue>Ms. Coltrane lived in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles near the Sai Anantam ashram in Agoura Hills , which she had founded in 1983 . <br><blue>5</blue>Known as Swami Turiyasangitananda , Sanskrit for '' the highest song of God , '' she was the guiding presence of the 48-acre ashram , set among the Santa Monica mountains , where 25 to 30 full-time residents study the Vedic scriptures of ancient India , as well as Buddhist and Islamic texts . <br><blue>6</blue>She was also the manager of Coltrane 's estate , as well as of his music-publishing company , Jowcol Music , and the John Coltrane Foundation , which has given out scholarships to music students since 2001 . <br><blue>7</blue>As a pianist , her playing was dense with arpeggios that suggested the harp ; the instrument had an important place in her life . <br><blue>8</blue>One of her childhood heroes was the Detroit-based jazz harpist Dorothy Ashby , and she was later motivated to study that instrument by Coltrane , who loved its sound . <br><blue>9</blue>Raised in a musical family in Detroit , Ms. Coltrane played piano and organ for church choirs and Sunday school from age 7 . <br><blue>10</blue>As a young musician in Detroit , she was studying classical music and playing piano in jazz clubs , in a group including her half-brother , the bassist Ernie Farrow , and the trombonist George Bohannon . <br><blue>11</blue>In her early 20s she lived briefly in Paris , where she studied informally with the pianist Bud Powell , and was briefly married to the singer Kenny ( Pancho ) Hagood , with whom she had a daughter , Michelle . <br><blue>12</blue>She returned to Detroit , playing in a band with her brother , and then moved to New York in 1962 . <br><blue>13</blue>A year later she met John Coltrane . <br><blue>14</blue>She was playing vibraphone and Powell-inspired bebop piano in a group led by the drummer Terry Gibbs at Birdland , on a double-bill with Coltrane 's quartet . <br><blue>15</blue>Coltrane was well established by the beginning of the 1960s , though she had n't known about him for long before moving to New York ; the first time she ever heard him , she said , was on the 1961 album '' Africa/Brass . '' <br><blue>16</blue>They connected instantly ; she moved in with him and traveled with the Coltrane band . <br><blue>17</blue>By the summer of 1964 they had relocated from New York City to a house in Dix Hills , on Long Island . <br><blue>18</blue>They married in 1965 in Ju√°rez , Mexico , coinciding with Coltrane 's divorce from his first wife , Naima Grubbs . <br><blue>19</blue>By that time she and Coltrane had already had two of their three children together -- John Jr. , who died in 1982 , and Ravi , who by his 30s had become an acclaimed jazz saxophonist . <br><blue>20</blue>Ms. Coltrane is survived by her sisters , Marilyn McLeod of Winnetka , Calif. , and Margaret Roberts of Detroit ; her daughter , Michelle Carbonell-Coltrane of Los Angeles ; her sons Oran Coltrane of Los Angeles and Ravi , of Brooklyn ; and five grandchildren . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>They</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (18_1) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>a group including her half-brother , the bassist Ernie Farrow , and the trombonist George Bohannon</m_str> (10_21) 	<br><blue>3(48)</blue>: <m_str>the jazz saxophonist John Coltrane</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_15) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_21) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>Ms. Coltrane</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_22) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>Coltrane 's</m_str> (6_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_23) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_3) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (8_15) 	<m_str>Coltrane</m_str> (8_24) 	<m_str>Ms. Coltrane</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_8) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_24) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_12) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_36) 	<m_str>Michelle</m_str> (11_41) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>John Coltrane</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>Coltrane 's</m_str> (14_25) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Coltrane</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_13) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_18) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_30) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_33) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_35) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_9) 	<m_str>Coltrane</m_str> (16_14) 	<m_str>Coltrane 's</m_str> (18_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>Coltrane</m_str> (19_6) 	<m_str>Ms. Coltrane</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_22) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_31) 	<m_str>Oran Coltrane of Los Angeles and Ravi , of Brooklyn</m_str> (20_33) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (19_30) 	<m_str>Ravi , who by his 30s had become an acclaimed jazz saxophonist</m_str> (19_26) 	<m_str>Ravi</m_str> (20_39) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (4_10) 	<m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (20_28) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>Detroit</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>Detroit</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>Detroit</m_str> (20_20) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (12_18) 	<m_str>New York City</m_str> (17_10) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>a band with her brother</m_str> (12_8) 	<m_str>the Coltrane band</m_str> (16_13) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>her life</m_str> (7_23) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
