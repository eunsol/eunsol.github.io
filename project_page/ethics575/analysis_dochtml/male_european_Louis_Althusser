<blue>1</blue>Louis Althusser , a French Communist philosopher who was a prominent critic of French and Soviet Communism in the 1970 's , died Monday of heart failure in a geriatric center outside Paris . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 72 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Althusser had taught for many years at the prestigious Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris and was himself one of its graduates . <br><blue>4</blue>In 1976 , The New York Times reported that Mr. Althusser had " delivered the most far-reaching , vehement attack on Soviet society , as well as the Soviet Communist Party , ever remembered from a leading Communist in good standing . " <br><blue>5</blue>The subjects of his writings ranged from contemporary Communism back to Montesquieu . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Althusser 's career ended suddenly late in 1980 when he strangled his wife , the former Helene Rytmann , a sociologist , in their Paris apartment . <br><blue>7</blue>Confesses to Killing Wife He immediately confessed to the killing . <br><blue>8</blue>The Paris police said he had a history of manic-depression , and a homicide charge against him was dismissed on the ground of insanity by a Paris court in 1981 . <br><blue>9</blue>After entering a psychiatric spital , he remained institutionalized until 1984 and spent his final years in professional and political eclipse . <br><blue>10</blue>Agence France-Presse described Mr. Althusser yesterday as " an intelligence broken by a personal drama . " <br><blue>11</blue>In the preface of a new book on Soviet science by Dominique Lecourt , Mr. Althusser denounced Stalinism as a huge mistake and contended that even after two decades " Soviet leaders still refuse to apply Marxist analysis to this gigantic error , which they have buried , along with its millions of victims , in the silence of the state . " <br><blue>12</blue>Communist ' Deviations ' Noted Earlier , he wrote that the Communist movement had been adversely affected for 40 years by what he called a deviation in the realm of economics : a stress on production instead of on egalitarianism , and on the police-state mechanisms employed to maintain production . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Althusser also publicly criticized various aspects of French Communism , notably the French party 's abandoning " the dictatorship of the proletariat " as a goal . <br><blue>14</blue>He called that abandonment a deviation toward the right that would blur the Communists ' identity . <br><blue>15</blue>Louis Althusser was born Oct. 16 , 1918 , at Birmandreis on the outskirts of Algiers . <br><blue>16</blue>Called to active military duty while still a student , he spent five years as a prisoner in Germany during World War II . <br><blue>17</blue>He joined the French Communist Party in 1948 . <br><blue>18</blue>In the same year , he began his more than three decades on the faculty of the Ecole Normale . <br><blue>19</blue>He became known for his analysis of Marx . <br><blue>20</blue>Le Monde said yesterday that he had brought to his studies of Marx " an unequaled precision and intelligence .
