<blue>1</blue>Pierre Verger , a worldly Parisian-born photographer whose quest for the natural life led him to an unlikely paradise in northeastern Brazil , died on Feb. 11 at his home in Salvador , the capital of the coastal Bahia state , where he was at once a renowned authority on the cultural links with Africa and a revered religious figure . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 93 . <br><blue>3</blue>In the years since he first came to Bahia in 1946 and became enchanted with the descendants of African slaves he found there , Mr. Verger had transformed himself from a roaming photographer into a scholar so obsessed with the local culture and religion that he spent 17 years studying their origins in Africa . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Verger , who became fluent in the Yoruba language , even managed to penetrate the mysterious Yoruban religious cults to the point that he was initiated into the priesthood in Dahomey , now Benin , becoming a babalao , or father of secrets , in the voodoo cult known in Brazil as candomble . <br><blue>5</blue>As the only babalao in Brazil , Mr. Verger , who was given the name Fatumbi ( reborn ) , was venerated by the people of Bahia even as he gained scholarly renown by publishing a series of works , including a book on the African-Brazilian slave trade that illuminated and explored the common threads of African and black Brazilian culture . <br><blue>6</blue>For Mr. Verger , the quest had been a long trip home . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Verger , whose family owned a prosperous printing business in Paris , was born in the stylish 16th arrondissement . <br><blue>8</blue>Despite a growing disenchantment with what he saw as an over-refined materialism , for a while in his 20 's he became the apotheosis of all he later deplored , living the life of a consummate dandy and even embracing the view that nothing was more important than whether one 's calling cards were engraved or merely printed . <br><blue>9</blue>Finally rejecting such absurdity with a vengeance , Mr. Verger , who had begun taking pictures during a visit to Corsica , sailed for Tahiti in 1932 , and with Gauguin as his guiding star sought the South Seas paradise . <br><blue>10</blue>For all the tropical delights and the charms of the Polynesian women , Mr. Verger found distressing signs of civilized encroachment . <br><blue>11</blue>After he visited the remote island of Bora Bora and found a calendar printed by his family company hanging in a hut , he abandoned his quest and returned to Paris . <br><blue>12</blue>There a chance visit to the Bal Negre left him so enchanted with the joyous , liberated world of black Parisian culture that he redirected his quest to the West Indies and eventually to Brazil , but not before he criss-crossed the world , taking pictures for Life magazine and other publications including coverage of Trotsky 's exile in Mexico and a memorable series on China in the 1930 's that has been widely exhibited . <br><blue>13</blue>As soon as he arrived in Bahia and discovered a world dominated by samba , festivals and candombles , Mr. Verger felt at home with the local people . <br><blue>14</blue>" I knew I was one of them , " he said . <br><blue>15</blue>In his extensive research on both sides of the south Atlantic , Mr. Verger established surprisingly strong continuing links between people in Africa and their Brazilian cousins who had been cut off from their home continent for generations . <br><blue>16</blue>For example , when a troupe of dancers from Benin visited Bahia and joined their hosts in a dance for dead souls , Mr. Verger , who had already attributed the sing-song Bahian accent to the melodious speech patterns of West Africa , was not surprised when the two groups acted out the ceremony in total harmony . <br><blue>17</blue>Although he took his religious position seriously , Mr. Verger , who said he had become a babalao primarily to gain access to the Yoruban secrets , always insisted that he was less a believer than an admirer of candomble . <br><blue>18</blue>" What I like about candomble , " he said recently , " is that it is the only major religion not based on good or evil , right or wrong . " <br><blue>19</blue>He is survived by his companion , Dona Ceci . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>the local people</m_str> (13_26) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Benin</m_str> (4_35) 	<m_str>Benin</m_str> (16_10) 	<br><blue>3(4)</blue>: <m_str>Bahia</m_str> (5_27) 	<m_str>Bahia</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>Bahia</m_str> (1_39) 	<m_str>Bahia</m_str> (16_12) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Gauguin</m_str> (9_31) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_33) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Africa</m_str> (15_23) 	<m_str>Africa</m_str> (3_54) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>candomble</m_str> (18_6) 	<m_str>candomble</m_str> (17_40) 	<br><blue>7(46)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (17_31) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger , who became fluent in the Yoruba language</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger</m_str> (3_25) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger</m_str> (15_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_7) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (3_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_26) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_25) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_21) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger , who was given the name Fatumbi -LRB- reborn -RRB-</m_str> (5_8) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (1_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_46) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_27) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_24) 	<m_str>Fatumbi</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_26) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger , who had already attributed the sing-song Bahian accent to the melodious speech patterns of West Africa</m_str> (16_24) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger , who said he had become a babalao primarily to gain access to the Yoruban secrets</m_str> (17_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger</m_str> (13_20) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_40) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger , whose family owned a prosperous printing business in Paris</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Verger</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_43) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_2) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>dancers from Benin</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (16_15) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>his quest</m_str> (11_26) 	<m_str>his quest</m_str> (12_26) 	<m_str>the quest</m_str> (6_5) 	<br><blue>10(3)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (15_34) 	<m_str>people in Africa</m_str> (15_21) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (15_25) 	<br><blue>11(3)</blue>: <m_str>Brazil</m_str> (4_52) 	<m_str>Brazil</m_str> (5_6) 	<m_str>Brazil</m_str> (12_35) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
