<blue>1</blue>Elias Canetti , a novelist , playwright and cultural historian who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981 , died on Saturday in Zurich . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 89 and had homes in London and Zurich . <br><blue>3</blue>On Wednesday , he was buried next to James Joyce . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Canetti , a Bulgarian who wrote in German , spent much of his creative life analyzing the individual and the social and political forces that weighed against him in the 20th century . <br><blue>5</blue>He first wrote on the subject in " Crowds and Power , " published in 1935 , just two years after Hitler came to power . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Canetti returned to the theme in his old age in a multi-volume autobiography that traces his , and 20th-century Europe 's , artistic and intellectual development . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Canetti was born to a family of Sephardic Jews in the port city of Ruschuk in what is now Bulgaria . <br><blue>8</blue>When he was 6 , the family moved to Manchester , England , and a year later , after Mr. Canetti 's father had died , the family moved to Vienna , and later to Zurich and Frankfurt . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Canetti grew up speaking German , English , French and Bulgarian . <br><blue>10</blue>To please his mother , he earned a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Vienna , but he had set his sights on becoming a writer . <br><blue>11</blue>He made an auspicious beginning with the novel " Auto-da-Fe , " the story of a reclusive scholar whose loutish wife forces him out of his apartment into the real world , where he undergoes degradation and torment before setting fire to himself and his books . <br><blue>12</blue>The novel was perceived as an attack on fascism and was banned in Germany . <br><blue>13</blue>Refugee From the Nazis Mr. Canetti wrote two plays , " The Wedding " and " The Comedy of Vanity , " before fleeing first to Paris and eventually to London ahead of the Nazis . <br><blue>14</blue>While taking part in a violent demonstration in Vienna in 1927 , he had become fascinated by the nature of crowds , and in London he began researching " Crowds and Power , " drawing on folklore , myth and anthropology to explain mass psychology and the allure of dictators . <br><blue>15</blue>The book , which Mr. Canetti called " my life 's work , " was not completed until 1960 . <br><blue>16</blue>While writing it , he kept notebooks and journals that were later published as " The Human Province " ( 1972 ) . <br><blue>17</blue>In addition to several plays , his other works included the books " Voices of Marrakesh " ( 1967 ) , " The Conscience of Words " ( 1979 ) , " Earwitness : Fifty Characters " ( 1982 ) and " Kafka 's Other Trial " ( 1988 ) , " The Secret Heart of the Clock " ( 1989 ) and " The Agony of Flies " ( 1994 ) . <br><blue>18</blue>The literary project that consumed his later years was an autobiography that recounted his spiritual and intellectual coming of age , and his encounters with such seminal artists as Bertolt Brecht , Karl Kraus , Isaac Babel and Georg Grosz . <br><blue>19</blue>The first three volumes were " The Tongue Set Free " ( 1979 ) , " The Torch in My Ear " ( 1982 ) and " The Play of the Eyes " ( 1986 ) . <br><blue>20</blue>He completed a fourth volume of memoirs , as yet untitled , that will be published by Farrar , Straus &amp;
