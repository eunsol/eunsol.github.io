<blue>1</blue>Bishop Donal Lamont , a Roman Catholic missionary who fought efforts to create an apartheid state in the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia -- now Zimbabwe -- after it declared its independence from Britain in 1965 , died on Aug. 14 in Dublin . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 92 . <br><blue>3</blue>Bishop Lamont was appointed first bishop of Umtali ( now Mutare ) in the highlands of eastern Rhodesia in 1957 . <br><blue>4</blue>He long criticized the racist policies of the white Rhodesian government of Prime Minister Ian D. Smith , and was put on trial in 1976 for allowing nuns in his diocese to give medical treatment to antigovernment black guerrillas and for failing to report the guerrillas ' whereabouts . <br><blue>5</blue>He pleaded guilty to these charges to prevent anyone else from incriminating themselves by testifying on his behalf and was sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment . <br><blue>6</blue>This was reduced on appeal to four years , with three suspended . <br><blue>7</blue>Then in 1977 , after a period of house arrest , he was stripped of his Rhodesian citizenship and deported . <br><blue>8</blue>The day before his first sentencing , the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Rhodesia , a group led by the bishop , publicly accused the Smith government of abducting and torturing its black political opponents who were fighting for majority rule . <br><blue>9</blue>In an open letter to the prime minister , he said , '' Far from your policies defending Christianity and Western civilization , as you claim , they mock the law of Christ and make Communism attractive to the African people . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Donal Raymond Lamont was born in Northern Ireland in Ballycastle , County Antrim . <br><blue>11</blue>He enrolled at Terenure College in Dublin , and entered the Carmelite Order in 1929 . <br><blue>12</blue>He studied at University College in Dublin , and at Collegio Sant ' Alberto in Rome . <br><blue>13</blue>He was ordained a priest in 1937 . <br><blue>14</blue>In 1946 he was sent with two other Carmelites to Southern Rhodesia , where they established a successful mission . <br><blue>15</blue>Throughout his tenure as bishop of Umtali , he was an increasingly vocal critic of the white government 's racial policies and its efforts to establish a racially segregated state on the South African model . <br><blue>16</blue>In his first pastoral letter , published in 1959 , when Rhodesia was still part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland , and titled '' A Purchased People , '' he questioned the legitimacy of colonial rule , saying , '' Any violent seizure of territory which was at the time inhabited and cultivated by a native tribe and subject to the authority of its rulers constitutes unjust aggression . '' <br><blue>17</blue>After the breakup of the federation in 1963 and Prime Minister Smith 's unilateral declaration of independence from Britain two years later , Bishop Lamont criticized the new segregationist Constitution and land apportionment acts , which divided the country into black and white areas , calling them '' a direct contradiction of the New Testament 's teaching . '' <br><blue>18</blue>Bishop Lamont was also active in church affairs outside Rhodesia . <br><blue>19</blue>At the Second Vatican Council , convened by Pope John XXIII in 1962 , he emerged as a powerful advocate for the church 's missionaries . <br><blue>20</blue>And at the World Synod of Bishops in Rome in 1971 , he questioned traditional church teaching on priestly celibacy , suggesting that '' suitable mature married men '' should be ordained when unmarried priests were in short supply . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>themselves</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>anyone else</m_str> (5_9) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>you</m_str> (9_25) 	<m_str>your</m_str> (9_16) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>two other Carmelites</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (14_15) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>the bishop</m_str> (8_22) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (1_32) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (1_30) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Rome</m_str> (12_16) 	<m_str>Rome</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Umtali</m_str> (3_8) 	<m_str>Umtali</m_str> (15_7) 	<br><blue>8(4)</blue>: <m_str>the white Rhodesian government of Prime Minister Ian D.
