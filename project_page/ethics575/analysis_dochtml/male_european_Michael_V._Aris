<blue>1</blue>It was as exotic an offer as a young college graduate could imagine . <br><blue>2</blue>Michael Aris , freshly out of Durham University with an honors degree in modern history , was invited to become the private tutor of the children of the royal family of the remote Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan . <br><blue>3</blue>In the six years he was to spend there , he began the intense acquaintance with the languages , history , art , religion and literature of the region that was to make him a leading Western authority on Bhutanese , Tibetan and Himalayan culture . <br><blue>4</blue>His death in an Oxford hospital on his 53d birthday Saturday drew much attention because he was the husband of the Nobel Prize-winning Burmese opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi . <br><blue>5</blue>But the academic achievements of the shy and modest Oxford don over three decades earned him high regard in his own right as a scholar who combined the study of textual sources with the experience of firsthand encounters and extensive travel . <br><blue>6</blue>It was during his college years that he met his future wife , who was studying philosophy , politics and economics at Oxford and staying in the home of a classmate of his whose father was Sir Paul Gore-Booth , a former British Ambassador to Burma . <br><blue>7</blue>It was in the Gore-Booths ' London home that the couple were married in a Buddhist ceremony on Jan. 1 , 1972 , after a courtship maintained largely by mail between Bhutan and England . <br><blue>8</blue>They spent the first year of their married life in Bhutan where Mr. Aris had become in addition to the royal tutor , the head of the kingdom 's translation department and its official history researcher . <br><blue>9</blue>They came to England a year later for Mr. Aris to do postgraduate studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London and in 1976 moved on to Oxford where Mr. Aris became a junior research fellow at St. John 's College and a member of the university faculty . <br><blue>10</blue>He obtained a Ph.D. in Tibetan literature in 1978 from the University of London . <br><blue>11</blue>The first 16 years of their life together were spent in academic pursuits and raising their children , Alexander , born in 1973 , and Kim , born in 1977 . <br><blue>12</blue>Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi studied , wrote and worked in the oriental department at the Bodleian Library . <br><blue>13</blue>The daughter of her country 's independence hero , Gen. Aung San , who was assassinated in 1947 , she expressed a preoccupation with the future in one of the hundreds of letters she wrote to Mr. Aris before their marriage . '' <br><blue>14</blue>Sometimes I am beset by fears that circumstances and national considerations might tear us apart just when we are so happy in each other that separation would be a torment , '' she wrote . <br><blue>15</blue>That moment arrived in an understated episode that Mr. Aris recalled in a forward to '' Freedom From Fear , '' a 1991 collection of essays by and about his wife . '' <br><blue>16</blue>It was a quiet evening in Oxford , like many others , the last day of March 1988 , '' he wrote . '' <br><blue>17</blue>Our sons were in bed and we were reading when the telephone rang . <br><blue>18</blue>Suu picked up the phone to learn that her mother had suffered a severe stroke . <br><blue>19</blue>She put the phone down at once and started to pack . <br><blue>20</blue>I had a premonition that our lives would change for ever .
