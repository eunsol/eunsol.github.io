<blue>1</blue>Paul Touvier , the only Frenchman to be convicted of war crimes against humanity and for half a century a troubling reminder of his country 's ambivalence about World War II , died yesterday at a prison hospital near Paris . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 81 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Touvier had suffered from prostate cancer , prison officials said . <br><blue>4</blue>On April 20 , 1994 , Mr. Touvier became the first Frenchman to be found guilty of war-related crimes against humanity for ordering the execution of seven Jews 50 years earlier , while he was serving in a pro-Nazi militia that had been set up by the collaborationist Vichy Government . <br><blue>5</blue>As he was sentenced to life imprisonment , Mr. Touvier continued to insist that he had sent the seven Jews to their deaths on June 29 , 1944 , at Rillieux-la-Pape near Lyons as a last resort to save the lives of 23 others who had also been marked for death . <br><blue>6</blue>In Mr. Touvier 's telling , the Germans at first had wanted 100 Jews put to death in retaliation for the assassination of Philippe Henriot , the Vichy Minister of Information , by Resistance fighters in Paris . <br><blue>7</blue>The Vichy militia in which he was a leader bargained the Germans down to 30 Jews , Mr. Touvier said , and he ordered the seven slain to appease the Nazis . <br><blue>8</blue>" I have never forgotten the victims of Rillieux , " Mr. Touvier said as his sentence was pronounced . <br><blue>9</blue>" I think of them every day , every evening . " <br><blue>10</blue>But even half a century after the killings , there were French people who remembered a far different Paul Touvier than the one he himself recalled . <br><blue>11</blue>They called him " the hangman of Lyons " and " the French Barbie , " after Klaus Barbie , the Lyons Gestapo chief whom Mr. Touvier served as intelligence chief of the local militia . <br><blue>12</blue>Investigators and French people old enough to remember the war said Mr. Touvier was an enthusiastic acolyte to Mr. Barbie , and that his crimes went far beyond the deaths of the seven Jews who faced the firing squad at Rillieux-la-Pape . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Touvier was suspected of having a role in the January 1944 deaths of a prominent human rights leader and his wife , who were taken from their homes by Vichy militia and Gestapo raiders and shot , as well as a raid on a synagogue whose caretakers , a husband and wife , were deported to Auschwitz and never seen again , and a raid on a fairgrounds near Lyons , where 57 Spanish refugees were rounded up and deported to death camps . <br><blue>14</blue>After the war , Mr. Touvier went into hiding . <br><blue>15</blue>Convicted in absentia of treason and consorting with the enemy for helping to torture and kill Resistance members , he was sentenced to death just after the war . <br><blue>16</blue>As he would later tell his captors , he remained free for a while by using phony identity papers and earning money by selling bootleg chocolate to candy stores and passing counterfeit currency . <br><blue>17</blue>He was arrested in 1947 while trying to hold up a bakery , but he managed to escape and lived in hiding with his new wife , Monique , and their daughter , Chantal , and son , Pierre , who survive him . <br><blue>18</blue>The statute of limitations for the crimes he was convicted of just after the war expired in 1967 . <br><blue>19</blue>In 1971 , President Georges Pompidou granted him what amounted to a pardon , permitting him to return to Lyons and recover his property . <br><blue>20</blue>Mr. Pompidou 's pardon , granted after he was quietly lobbied by some Roman Catholic Church officials , provoked a national outcry that intensified when it was revealed that much of the property Mr. Touvier called his own had really been seized from deported Jews . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Pompidou 's</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>President Georges Pompidou</m_str> (19_4) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Rillieux-la-Pape near Lyons</m_str> (5_31) 	<m_str>Rillieux-la-Pape</m_str> (12_41) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Germans</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>the Germans</m_str> (6_7) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Vichy</m_str> (13_31) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Paris</m_str> (1_40) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (6_37) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>the victims of Rillieux</m_str> (8_6) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>the war</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>the war</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>the war</m_str> (15_27) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Lyons</m_str> (13_71) 	<m_str>Lyons</m_str> (5_33) 	<br><blue>9(40)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (7_18) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_23) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_20) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_9) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_8) 	<m_str>a far different Paul Touvier than the one</m_str> (10_16) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (11_3) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (10_25) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (19_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (17_43) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (19_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (11_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_23) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_34) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier 's</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_21) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Touvier</m_str> (20_34) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_37) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_6) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>humanity</m_str> (4_21) 	<m_str>humanity</m_str> (1_14) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>The Vichy militia in which he was a leader</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>the local militia</m_str> (11_33) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
