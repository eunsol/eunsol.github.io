<blue>1</blue>Christopher Fry , the British playwright who created memorable parts for John Gielgud , Laurence Olivier and Edith Evans , gave Richard Burton his first role on Broadway , and was primarily responsible for the script of '' Ben-Hur , '' among other films , died on Thursday in Chichester , England . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 97 . <br><blue>3</blue>His death was announced by his son , Tam . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Fry will mainly be remembered as the most gifted of the writers who were impelled by the example of T.S. Eliot to attempt a revival of verse-drama in the verbally arid theater of the 1940 's and 1950 's . <br><blue>5</blue>Although his reputation declined after the arrival of John Osborne and the '' kitchen-sink '' realists in 1956 , his best-known play , '' The Lady 's Not for Burning '' continues to be produced regularly . <br><blue>6</blue>There was a time when Mr. Fry was a major force in the British theater . <br><blue>7</blue>Five of his major dramas , plus his translation of a Jean Anouilh play , achieved critical and public success in the five years beginning in 1946 . <br><blue>8</blue>But Mr. Fry 's intentions were more spiritual in nature . <br><blue>9</blue>His plays radiated an optimistic faith in God and humanity , evoking , in his words , '' a world in which we are poised on the edge of eternity , a world which has deeps and shadows of mystery , and God is anything but a sleeping partner . '' <br><blue>10</blue>He said he wrote his plays in poetry because that was '' the language in which man expresses his own amazement '' at the complexity both of himself and of a reality which , beneath the surface , was '' wildly , perilously , inexplicably fantastic . '' <br><blue>11</blue>Christopher Fry Harris was born in Bristol , England , on Dec. 18 , 1907 , the son of Charles John Harris , a master builder who became a full-time lay preacher in the Church of England , and the former Emma Marguerite Fry Hammond . <br><blue>12</blue>When he was 4 , his father died , and two years later his mother moved to Bedford , where she and her sister took in lodgers to help pay for schooling . <br><blue>13</blue>While still young , Christopher changed his last name to that of his maternal grandmother , who was thought , on what the dramatist later admitted to be '' slight evidence , '' to be related to the family that produced the Victorian prison reformer Elizabeth Fry . <br><blue>14</blue>Whatever the truth , Christopher eventually espoused the Fry clan 's Quaker faith and became a lifelong pacifist . <br><blue>15</blue>He attended the Bedford Modern School , where he developed an intense interest in the theater and wrote what he later called '' useless , untutored stuff , '' including a play called '' Armageddon , '' about refugees from a devastated world surviving on a remote island . '' <br><blue>16</blue>Armageddon '' reflected his experience of World War I , which consisted of watching scores of gun carriages bearing dead men file past his house to the local cemetery . <br><blue>17</blue>This memory was to have some impact on several of his plays , notably '' A Sleep of Prisoners , '' in which captured soldiers have dreams that vividly embody questions about the morality of violence . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Fry briefly considered a career as a minister , but instead became a teacher at a school , where he wrote the words for a choral work by a fellow teacher . <br><blue>19</blue>But from 1929 onward , he committed himself to the theater : acting and directing , writing pantomimes and musical shows for amateurs , and running a repertory company in Tunbridge Wells , where he presented the premiere of '' A Village Wooing '' by Shaw in 1934 . <br><blue>20</blue>He also was commissioned to write a play about Dr. Thomas John Barnardo , the founder of a network of children 's homes , which toured Britain in 1935 and 1936 and included in its amateur cast a teenager called Deborah Trimmer , who later became Deborah Kerr . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>God</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>God</m_str> (9_43) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (20_35) 	<m_str>Britain</m_str> (20_27) 	<br><blue>3(41)</blue>: <m_str>Richard Burton</m_str> (1_22) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_24) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>his son , Tam</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>Tam</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Fry</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>John Osborne</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_20) 	<m_str>Mr. Fry</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>a Jean Anouilh</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Fry 's</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_15) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>his father</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>Christopher</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>the dramatist</m_str> (13_23) 	<m_str>Christopher</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Fry</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_6) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (19_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Armageddon</m_str> (15_35) 	<m_str>Armageddon</m_str> (16_1) 	<br><blue>5(5)</blue>: <m_str>himself</m_str> (10_28) 	<m_str>man</m_str> (10_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_19) 	<m_str>Christopher Fry Harris</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_14) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>the verbally arid theater of the 1940 's and 1950 's</m_str> (4_30) 	<m_str>the British theater</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>the theater</m_str> (15_15) 	<br><blue>7(4)</blue>: <m_str>she</m_str> (12_21) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_23) 	<m_str>his mother</m_str> (12_14) 	<m_str>the Victorian prison reformer Elizabeth Fry</m_str> (13_42) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>T.S.
