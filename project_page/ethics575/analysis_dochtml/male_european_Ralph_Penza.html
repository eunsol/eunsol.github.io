<blue>1</blue>Ralph Penza , an award-winning television news reporter and backup anchor for WNBC-TV in New York City , died early yesterday morning after a long illness , a spokeswoman for NBC said . <br><blue>2</blue>Mr. Penza was 74 and lived in Manhattan . <br><blue>3</blue>His death was announced yesterday by NBC . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Penza , a senior correspondent for WNBC-TV , was best known for his aggressive reporting style and investigative news series , which often carried provocative titles like '' Killer Fish '' and '' Dangerous Doctors . '' <br><blue>5</blue>He was also known for his signature '' walking stand-ups , '' in which the camera would follow him as he moved around a scene instead of standing still in one spot . <br><blue>6</blue>Throughout his career , Mr. Penza 's breaking news reports and television news series earned him various prestigious awards , including six Emmys and two '' Gold Typewriter '' awards from the New York Press Club . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Penza began his career while in high school , when he went to work as a copy boy for the legendary gossip columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell . <br><blue>8</blue>After studying radio and television at New York University , Mr. Penza went to work as a news director for several small television stations -- first in Indiana then in Georgia -- before landing a job at WABC-TV in New York in 1961 as a news writer and producer of the evening newscast . <br><blue>9</blue>Later , Mr. Penza moved to WCBS-TV in New York , where he was promoted to news reporter . <br><blue>10</blue>In that role , he became one of the station 's most popular on-air personalities . <br><blue>11</blue>In 1972 , as part of an effort to improve its sagging ratings , the station named Mr. Penza the co-anchor of its nightly 11 p.m. newscasts along with Jim Jensen . <br><blue>12</blue>According to a New York Times article at the time , it was an open secret that Channel 2 had conducted taped public samplings of at least a half-dozen news reporters -- from New York and elsewhere -- and found that Mr. Penza was scored highly by its viewers . <br><blue>13</blue>In October 1980 , Mr. Penza joined WNBC-TV as a reporter and weekend anchor . <br><blue>14</blue>In one series that earned him an Emmy in 2000 he went overseas to cover Pope John Paul II 's visit to the Holy Land , filing reports from Jerusalem , Tel Aviv , Bethlehem and other cities along the way . <br><blue>15</blue>A longtime producer of his , Diane Drummey Marino , said Mr. Penza was as comfortable and fearless reporting live in front of a mosque in Israel with bullets whizzing past his head as he was back in New York chasing down scam artists and criminals . '' <br><blue>16</blue>I used to say he was like the Dalmatian in the firehouse , '' she said . '' <br><blue>17</blue>He lived to report the news and to let people know what was going on so they could make decisions that were informed . <br><blue>18</blue>He was a Brooklyn guy who loved New York and never thought of himself as above his viewers . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Penza was a member of the Inner Circle , an organization of political reporters , and was the first television journalist to be named its president . <br><blue>20</blue>He is survived by his wife , Lucille , and two children . <br><hr><br><blue>1(6)</blue>: <m_str>New York City</m_str> (1_15) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (8_40) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (12_34) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (15_39) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (18_8) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>the station 's</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>the station</m_str> (11_15) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (12_12) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (17_17) 	<m_str>people</m_str> (17_10) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>his career</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>his career</m_str> (7_4) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (11_23) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (11_11) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (12_48) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>NBC</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>NBC</m_str> (3_7) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>WNBC-TV</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>WNBC-TV</m_str> (13_8) 	<br><blue>8(35)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Penza</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza , a senior correspondent for WNBC-TV</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_6) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (5_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza 's</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (6_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza the co-anchor of its nightly 11 p.m. newscasts along</m_str> (11_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza</m_str> (12_42) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza</m_str> (15_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_32) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_35) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Penza</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_5) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
