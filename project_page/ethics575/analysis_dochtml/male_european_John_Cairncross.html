<blue>1</blue>John Cairncross , the " Fifth Man " in a ring of British spies that gave Western secrets to the Soviet Union , died on Sunday at his home in the west of England . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 82 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Cairncross , who had returned to Britain earlier this year after living since the 1950 's in France , had suffered two strokes , the most recent a month ago , said Rupert Allason , a Member of Parliament who edited Mr. Cairncross 's forthcoming memoirs . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Cairncross was the least known of the famous spy ring , whose members met at Cambridge University in the late 1930 's , and the last to die . <br><blue>5</blue>He insisted that he worked independently of the others -- Guy Burgess , Harold ( Kim ) Philby , Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt -- and that he was motivated to pass information to the Soviet Union during World War II because he believed it would help defeat Hitler . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Cairncross , who held a variety of positions in the British Government , came under suspicion in 1951 when notes he had written were found in Mr. Burgess 's apartment just after Mr. Burgess fled to Moscow . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Cairncross was interrogated but not charged , and was told to leave Britain and never return . <br><blue>8</blue>After Mr. Blunt 's participation in the spy ring was first discovered in 1964 , Mr. Cairncross was again interrogated . <br><blue>9</blue>He admitted spying , but said he had never passed Moscow any information harmful to Britain 's interests . <br><blue>10</blue>Again , British officials decided not to charge him . <br><blue>11</blue>It was widely believed that there had been a fifth Soviet spy involved in the ring , but while there was widespread speculation about this identity , Mr. Cairncross was not positively identified as " the Fifth Man " until 1991 , when he was named by Yuri Modin , the former Soviet intelligence official who oversaw the activities of all five of the spies . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Modin was later quoted as saying that Mr. Cairncross 's information had gone well beyond helping in the effort against Hitler , and included early intelligence about nuclear weapons research by the United States and Britain . <br><blue>13</blue>But Mr. Cairncross , in an interview with a British newspaper last month , said he was not a traitor . <br><blue>14</blue>" There was a hard core of three and Kim Philby was associated with them , " Mr. Cairncross told the newspaper , The Mail on Sunday . <br><blue>15</blue>" Then there was me , who was a loner outside . " <br><blue>16</blue>" I hope this will put an end to the Fifth Man mystery , " Mr. Cairncross said . <br><blue>17</blue>" I was promoted to become one of the Five after the Battle of Kursk in 1943 . <br><blue>18</blue>I had provided information which helped the Soviets to win that battle against the Germans . " <br><blue>19</blue>The information passed to Moscow by Mr. Cairncross was gleaned from his work at Britain 's communications-monitoring operation . <br><blue>20</blue>He passed to the Soviets decoded German signals disclosing the location of Luftwaffe units . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Hitler</m_str> (5_49) 	<m_str>Hitler</m_str> (12_22) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Cairncross 's information</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>The information</m_str> (19_1) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Anthony Blunt</m_str> (5_23) 	<m_str>Mr. Blunt 's</m_str> (8_2) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>Britain</m_str> (12_37) 	<m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (19_15) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>France</m_str> (3_19) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (5_45) 	<m_str>World War II</m_str> (5_39) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_28) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<br><blue>8(31)</blue>: <m_str>Rupert Allason , a Member of Parliament who edited Mr. Cairncross 's forthcoming memoirs</m_str> (3_34) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross 's</m_str> (3_43) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_43) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_28) 	<m_str>Mr. Burgess 's</m_str> (6_28) 	<m_str>Mr. Burgess</m_str> (6_34) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross , who held a variety of positions in the British Government</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_22) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross</m_str> (11_28) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_44) 	<m_str>Mr. Modin</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross 's</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross , in an interview with a British newspaper last month</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>me</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (16_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross</m_str> (16_16) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Cairncross was gleaned from his work at Britain 's communications-monitoring operation</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Sunday</m_str> (1_26) 	<m_str>Sunday</m_str> (14_27) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>a British newspaper</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>the newspaper , The Mail on Sunday</m_str> (14_21) 	<br><blue>11(3)</blue>: <m_str>the famous spy ring , whose members met at Cambridge University in the late 1930 's , and the last to die</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>the spy ring</m_str> (8_7) 	<m_str>the ring</m_str> (11_15) 	<br><blue>12(1)</blue>: <m_str>Kim Philby</m_str> (14_10) 	<br><blue>13(1)</blue>: <m_str>Donald Maclean</m_str> (5_20) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
