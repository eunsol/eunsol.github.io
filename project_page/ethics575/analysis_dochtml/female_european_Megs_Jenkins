<blue>1</blue>Megs Jenkins , a British stage , film and television actress who specialized in playing kindly , matronly characters , died on Oct. 5 , said a spokeswoman for the Gordon Rodwell Funeral Service in Felixstow , Suffolk , where her funeral was held . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 81 . <br><blue>3</blue>Miss Jenkins played many parts in her long career , but she was best known for her portrayal of nurses , governesses , maids , cooks , long-suffering wives and wise mothers . <br><blue>4</blue>With her unglamorous looks and her plump , open face , she seemed made for sympathy and found herself typecast in supporting , or supportive , roles . <br><blue>5</blue>Born Muguette Mary Jenkins in Birkenhead , Cheshire , in 1917 , Miss Jenkins harbored dreams of becoming a ballet dancer but turned to acting , and dispensed with her exotic first name , she said , when she realized that she did not have a dancer 's physique . '' <br><blue>6</blue>It was sad , really , '' she once said . '' <br><blue>7</blue>I was this same unsylphlike shape when I was 17 . <br><blue>8</blue>I had fancied I might call myself by my real name , Muguette , once I became a ballerina . <br><blue>9</blue>But I had to face the fact that I was quite definitely a Megs . '' <br><blue>10</blue>After studying at the School of Dancing and Dramatic Art in Liverpool , she took her first professional role , as a German hausfrau in '' The Lift That Failed , '' in a production by the Liverpool Repertory Company in 1933 . <br><blue>11</blue>She remained with the company for four years , then moved to London . <br><blue>12</blue>She had a long and distinguished stage career , veering several times from the roles in which she was typecast : she played a cruel , mentally unstable mother in Tennessee Williams 's '' Summer and Smoke '' ( 1951 ) , for instance , and the title role in Pinero 's '' School Mistress '' ( 1954 ) . <br><blue>13</blue>She was particularly praised for her role as a show-business fan in Emlyn Williams 's '' Light of Heart '' ( 1940 ) and for her portrayal of the mother of a possible second messiah in a Welsh farming community during the Crimean War in another Emlyn Williams play , '' The Wind of Heaven '' ( 1945 ) . <br><blue>14</blue>In 1956 , she won the Clarence Derwent Award , then Britain 's highest stage prize , for best supporting performance in Arthur Miller 's '' View from the Bridge , '' in which she played a wife trying desperately to ignore her husband 's incestuous feelings for his niece . <br><blue>15</blue>During World War II , she appeared in a number of patriotic movies intended to boost morale and support the war effort , including '' Millions Like Us '' ( 1943 ) , about wartime factory workers , and '' The Lamp Still Burns , '' in which she played , not for the first or last time , a nurse . <br><blue>16</blue>She appeared in dozens of films , including '' The Brothers '' ( 1947 ) , a strange melodrama set on the Isle of Skye ; '' The Innocents '' ( 1961 ) , a film based on Henry James 's novella '' The Turn of the Screw , '' in which she played the nervous housemaid , and '' Indiscreet '' ( 1958 ) , playing Ingrid Bergman 's housekeeper . <br><blue>17</blue>Perhaps her most successful film was '' The History of Mr. Polly '' ( 1949 ) , an adaption of H. G. Wells 's comic novel , in which she seemed perfectly cast as a homey , dependable landlady . <br><blue>18</blue>Her television work included a role in the popular series '' All Creatures Great and Small , '' based on the James Herriot books , and a part in the comedy series '' Young at Heart , '' in which she played a bickering retiree opposite John Mills , who had been her co-star in '' The History of Mr. Polly . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Miss Jenkins 's 1943 marriage to George Routledge , a commando who had been a childhood classmate , and who renewed their acquaintance when he saw her name in a review , ended in divorce in 1959 . <br><hr><br><blue>1(9)</blue>: <m_str>my</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>myself</m_str> (8_7) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>her role</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>her first professional role</m_str> (10_16) 	<br><blue>3(40)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (3_17) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_53) 	<m_str>Miss Jenkins 's</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_12) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_35) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>herself</m_str> (4_19) 	<m_str>Muguette Mary Jenkins</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (14_43) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (18_41) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_18) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_27) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_22) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Miss Jenkins</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_53) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_8) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_49) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Miss Jenkins</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_26) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_35) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_41) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_16) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_39) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (3_12) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_42) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (17_30) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the company for four years</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>the Liverpool Repertory Company</m_str> (10_37) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Emlyn Williams 's</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>Tennessee Williams 's</m_str> (12_31) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>her exotic first name</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>her name</m_str> (19_27) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>her husband 's</m_str> (14_43) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_49) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
