<blue>1</blue>Horst P. Horst , a master of light and deep shadow whose photographs of fashion and fashionable creatures like Coco Chanel , Marlene Dietrich and Noel Coward evoked the glamorous 1930 's as well as his own chic circle in Paris , died yesterday at his home in Palm Beach Gardens , Fla . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 93 . <br><blue>3</blue>The photographer , who was known from the beginning of his expansive career as , simply , Horst , had been in failing health since suffering from pneumonia last year , said Richard J. Horst , his manager and archivist , who also became his adopted son . <br><blue>4</blue>Best known for his classical images of models and society figures posed in dramatic , often Greek-inspired settings , Horst started taking pictures in 1931 as a protege of the aristocratic photographer George Hoyningen-Huene and continued to work until 1991 , photographing subjects as diverse as Jean Cocteau , Harry S. Truman , Maria Callas , Gertrude Stein and Andy Warhol , as well as settings like the Iranian deserts and interiors of Irish castles . '' <br><blue>5</blue>He really was the 20th century , '' said the photographer Eric Boman , who met Horst in 1978 , when both were assigned to photograph the French fashion collections , and who subsequently became a regular visitor to Horst 's home in Oyster Bay . <br><blue>6</blue>Many of the furnishings there were from his friend Chanel , and a portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy , leaning against a White House pillar , hung in a bathroom . <br><blue>7</blue>The people he knew , the clothes he photographed , conjure up a world where elegance and manners still mattered , and indeed Horst was himself a specimen of prewar savoir-faire , with blond hair and a trim , muscular body . <br><blue>8</blue>His settings were often highly stylized , and he preferred to work in a studio , where he could use artificial light to impose an unreality on his subjects , elevating them to a glamorous ideal . <br><blue>9</blue>In a 1984 biography by Valentine Lawford , a former British foreign service officer who became Horst 's companion , Horst recalled a photo session in 1935 with the Comtesse de la Falaise for French Vogue : '' To get this shot , it took two days . <br><blue>10</blue>It was the idea that counted then , not the sort of nervous rush they work in today . '' <br><blue>11</blue>Horst also had an exquisite , if slightly eccentric , eye for detail , and in his early years as a photographer for French Vogue he would shoo away overly fastidious fashion editors who tried to make immaculate his settings -- fussing with a stray flower , for instance . '' <br><blue>12</blue>My best pictures always have a little mess -- a dirty ashtray , something , '' he said . <br><blue>13</blue>And when he was asked by Diana Vreeland , the editor in chief of American Vogue , to photograph interiors , he was equally adept at recognizing the details that brought out the inhabitants ' personalities . '' <br><blue>14</blue>The cravats around the carafes of wine at the Rothschilds ' house in Mouton , '' mused Mrs. Vreeland in 1984 . '' <br><blue>15</blue>The Duke of Windsor 's red leather dispatch box marked ' The King . ' <br><blue>16</blue>When those pictures came in , I went berserk . <br><blue>17</blue>I 'd be intoxicated for hours . '' <br><blue>18</blue>The younger of two sons of a well-to-do hardware merchant , Horst Paul Albert Bohrmann was born Aug. 14 , 1906 , in the eastern German town of Weiseenfels-an-der-Saale . <br><blue>19</blue>Although he seldom bothered to use his surname even as a fledgling photographer among an expatriate crowd in Paris in the early 30 's , he formally dropped it in 1943 , after he had become an American citizen , so as not to be confused with the Nazi official Martin Bormann . <br><blue>20</blue>He legally changed his name to Horst P. Horst . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>his subjects</m_str> (8_28) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (8_32) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (9_44) 	<m_str>the Comtesse de la Falaise for French Vogue</m_str> (9_29) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>My best pictures</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>those pictures</m_str> (16_2) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (16_7) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_1) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>the aristocratic photographer George Hoyningen-Huene</m_str> (4_30) 	<br><blue>6(37)</blue>: <m_str>Noel Coward</m_str> (1_26) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_46) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_37) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_45) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>Horst</m_str> (4_20) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Horst</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>Horst 's</m_str> (5_40) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_8) 	<m_str>Horst</m_str> (7_24) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (7_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_28) 	<m_str>Horst 's</m_str> (9_17) 	<m_str>Horst</m_str> (9_21) 	<m_str>Horst</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_26) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_39) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_22) 	<m_str>Horst Paul Albert Bohrmann</m_str> (18_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_34) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_4) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (19_29) 	<m_str>his surname</m_str> (19_7) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Paris</m_str> (1_41) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (19_19) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>French Vogue</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>American Vogue</m_str> (13_15) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>Chanel</m_str> (6_10) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
