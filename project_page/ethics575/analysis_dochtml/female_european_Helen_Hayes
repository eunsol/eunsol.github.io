<blue>1</blue>Helen Hayes , the tiny actress whose big-hearted portrayals of Queen Victoria and other regal women helped make her one of the century 's best-loved stars , died yesterday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack , N.Y . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 92 and lived in Nyack . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was heart failure , said John Springer , her longtime press agent and friend . <br><blue>4</blue>Miss Hayes was admitted to the hospital on March 9 suffering from congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat . <br><blue>5</blue>The human warmth and masterly acting technique that Miss Hayes brought to the stage and screen earned her many triumphs in her long career . <br><blue>6</blue>She was one of the three great women of the American theater , with Katharine Cornell and Lynn Fontanne , in its glory days of the 1920 's and 30 's . <br><blue>7</blue>Lights Dimmed on Broadway In tribute to the actress , who was often called the First Lady of the American theater , Broadway marquees were dimmed for one minute last night at 8 P.M. Miss Hayes 's greatest stage success was the 1935 drama " Victoria Regina , " in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood to widowhood , aging visibly from act to act thanks to the makeup artist 's skill , and her own . <br><blue>8</blue>Her other stage triumphs included the title roles in " Mary of Scotland " ( 1933 ) and " Harriet " ( 1943 ) , about Harriet Beecher Stowe . <br><blue>9</blue>Her first great success was in " Coquette " in 1927 , and her last was in the 1970 revival of " Harvey . " <br><blue>10</blue>Miss Hayes won an Academy Award for best actress for her first major film role , in " The Sin of Madelon Claudet " ( 1931 ) . <br><blue>11</blue>She went on to star in screen hits including " Arrowsmith " ( 1931 ) opposite Ronald Colman , " A Farewell to Arms " ( 1932 ) with Gary Cooper , and " Night Flight " ( 1933 ) , in which she joined John Barrymore in an all-star cast . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1971 she won a second Oscar , as best supporting actress , for " Airport . " <br><blue>13</blue>With her bright eyes and elfin smile , Miss Hayes 's looks were highly winsome , and through sheer grace and stagecraft she was able to convey an impression of downright beauty when she chose . <br><blue>14</blue>Although she was only 5 feet tall and weighed a mere 100 pounds , she could also create an aura of strength and weight and splendor if a role required one . <br><blue>15</blue>" Tremulously magnificent " was the way Brooks Atkinson , as drama critic of The New York Times , described her opening-night performance in " Victoria Regina . " <br><blue>16</blue>" Since the Queen is dead , God rest her soul , " he wrote , " let the cheers go to her actress , who deserves all the homage the town contains . " <br><blue>17</blue>And audiences did cheer , again and again over the years , partly because of Miss Hayes 's skill and versatility -- she performed comedy and drama with equal skill -- and partly because her warmheartedness always put them on her side . <br><blue>18</blue>An Active Role In Public Life Once Miss Hayes was established as a great star , she threw herself into many areas of public life . <br><blue>19</blue>She was president of the American Theater Wing and the American National Theater and Academy and was the national chairwoman of women 's activities for the March of Dimes . <br><blue>20</blue>She was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church , was denied its sacraments after marrying the playwright Charles MacArthur -- who had been divorced -- and returned to the church after his death in 1956 . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Nyack</m_str> (1_34) 	<m_str>Nyack</m_str> (2_7) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>God</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_14) 	<br><blue>3(41)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (15_21) 	<m_str>the Queen</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>`` Victoria Regina</m_str> (15_25) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_10) 	<m_str>Queen Victoria</m_str> (1_11) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_23) 	<m_str>Miss Hayes 's</m_str> (17_16) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (17_23) 	<m_str>Miss Hayes</m_str> (18_8) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_35) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>herself</m_str> (18_19) 	<m_str>Miss Hayes</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_41) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Miss Hayes</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_18) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_22) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Miss Hayes 's</m_str> (7_35) 	<m_str>Victoria Regina , '' in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood</m_str> (7_46) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_14) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_52) 	<m_str>Miss Hayes</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_78) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_44) 	<m_str>Miss Hayes 's</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_23) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_15) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_34) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>last night</m_str> (7_30) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Broadway</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>Broadway</m_str> (7_23) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (20_33) 	<m_str>Charles MacArthur</m_str> (20_19) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (20_13) 	<m_str>the Roman Catholic Church</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the American theater</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>the American theater</m_str> (7_19) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>Her first great success</m_str> (9_1) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>1931</m_str> (10_26) 	<m_str>1931</m_str> (11_14) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>1933</m_str> (11_39) 	<m_str>1933</m_str> (8_16) 	<br><blue>12(1)</blue>: <m_str>the years</m_str> (17_10) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
