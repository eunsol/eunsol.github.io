<blue>1</blue>Benny Ong , a Manchurian-born immigrant who rose through underworld struggles in New York to become what law-enforcement officials called the leader of the most powerful organized crime group in Chinatown over the past 20 years , died early yesterday at New York Downtown Hospital . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 87 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause of death was not disclosed , but Mr. Ong 's family , who had kept a vigil at his bedside in recent days , had said in an interview with The Daily News earlier in the week that he entered the hospital two weeks ago , suffering from prostate cancer and pneumonia . <br><blue>4</blue>The family made no statement yesterday . <br><blue>5</blue>In keeping with the secrecy that surrounded much of his life , Mr. Ong , whose real name was Kai Sui Ong , had apparently been hospitalized under a pseudonym . <br><blue>6</blue>A hospital spokeswoman , Maureen Flatley , said no one named Ong was registered as a patient . <br><blue>7</blue>But Richard Eng , executive secretary of the Hip Sing Association , confirmed that the man long known as the Godfather of Chinatown had died , and he said three days of public ceremonies marking the occasion would be held in Chinatown Aug. 17 to 19 . <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Eng denied that Hip Sing or Mr. Ong were involved in criminal activities , and referred to Mr. Ong simply as " a very nice old man . " <br><blue>9</blue>Through the Decades From pushcart days of the Roaring 20 's through the era of cellular phones and global networks , Mr. Ong was a familiar figure on Pell Street in Chinatown , where he lived and operated , walking about with a cane , consulting associates in the tangled , narrow byways and sipping tea or playing Pai Gaw poker with friends . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Ong , also known as Uncle Seven because he was the seventh child in his family , had the formal title of adviser-in-chief-for-life of the Hip Sing Association , the largest of the 70 tongs that have dominated life for a century in the teeming Chinatown district in lower Manhattan , where 300,000 people live in 40 blocks of shops , factories , restaurants , tenements and housing projects . <br><blue>11</blue>Organized like traditional secret societies in China , tongs are business and neighborhood associations , many with tens of thousands of members and with chapters in cities across the country and abroad , that provide merchants and immigrants with credit unions , social outlets , job markets and other legitimate services . <br><blue>12</blue>But law-enforcement officials say the Hip Sing , with New York headquarters at 16 Pell Street , and a few other major tong groups have provided cover for wide-ranging , behind-the-scenes criminal activities , from extortion and theft to gambling , smuggling , drugs , prostitution and murder , using international contacts and employing notorious street gangs to carry out many of their activities . <br><blue>13</blue>Cited in Senate Report Mr. Ong has repeatedly been identified by the New York Police Department and Federal Government investigators as a Hip Sing organized-crime leader . <br><blue>14</blue>A United States Senate subcommittee report in 1992 described him as the " so-called Godfather of Chinatown " and leader of the Hip Sing Tong , which has used the Flying Dragons street gang as its enforcers . <br><blue>15</blue>While others held executive titles , real power was exercised by Mr. Ong in his advisory role , the report said . <br><blue>16</blue>" Now in his 80 's , Ong has long been associated with organized crime in Chinatown , " it said . <br><blue>17</blue>" Mr. Ong invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer questions during a staff deposition . " <br><blue>18</blue>An organizational chart in the report showed three tongs in Chinatown besides the 140-year-old Hip Sing -- the On Leong Association , which reportedly uses the Ghost Shadows gang ; the Tung On Association , reportedly using the Tung On Boys , and the Fukien American Association , reportedly employing a gang known as Fuk Ching . <br><blue>19</blue>According to " Chinatown : A Portrait of a Closed Society , " a 1992 book ( HarperCollins ) by Gwen Kinkead , Mr. Ong was born in Harbin , China , in 1907 and , following an older brother , immigrated to New York in 1923 , when he was 16 . <br><blue>20</blue>He first worked in a Chinatown laundry and took other menial jobs , and like thousands of young immigrants he soon joined the Hip Sing Tong . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Hip Sing Association</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>the Hip Sing Association , the largest of the 70 tongs that have dominated life for a century in the teeming Chinatown district</m_str> (10_26) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>1992</m_str> (19_15) 	<m_str>1992</m_str> (14_8) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>China</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>China</m_str> (19_31) 	<br><blue>4(30)</blue>: <m_str>the man long known as the Godfather of Chinatown</m_str> (7_15) 	<m_str>Mr. Eng</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Ong in his advisory role</m_str> (15_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Ong</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>Ong</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>to Mr. Ong simply</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Ong</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>the leader of the most powerful organized crime group in Chinatown</m_str> (1_21) 	<m_str>Mr. Ong , also known as Uncle Seven because he was the seventh child in his family</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Ong</m_str> (9_22) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_16) 	<m_str>his family</m_str> (10_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_35) 	<m_str>Mr. Ong 's</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Ong 's family , who had kept a vigil at his bedside in recent days</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>The family</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_41) 	<m_str>Mr. Ong</m_str> (19_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Ong , whose real name was Kai Sui Ong</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>Senate Report Mr. Ong</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_20) 	<m_str>Kai Sui Ong</m_str> (5_20) 	<m_str>Ong</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_50) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>the report</m_str> (15_19) 	<m_str>A United States Senate subcommittee report in 1992</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (16_20) 	<m_str>the report</m_str> (18_5) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>notorious street gangs</m_str> (12_55) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (12_63) 	<br><blue>7(4)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (16_4) 	<m_str>organized-crime leader</m_str> (13_25) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (14_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_15) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Tong , which has used the Flying Dragons street gang as its enforcers</m_str> (14_25) 	<m_str>Tong</m_str> (20_26) 	<br><blue>9(5)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (19_44) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>New York Downtown Hospital</m_str> (1_42) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>the hospital</m_str> (3_43) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Flying Dragons street gang</m_str> (14_30) 	<m_str>the Ghost Shadows gang</m_str> (18_26) 	<br><blue>11(9)</blue>: <m_str>Chinatown</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>Chinatown</m_str> (7_42) 	<m_str>Chinatown</m_str> (16_17) 	<m_str>Chinatown</m_str> (9_32) 	<m_str>Chinatown</m_str> (10_47) 	<m_str>Chinatown</m_str> (20_6) 	<m_str>Chinatown</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>Chinatown</m_str> (7_23) 	<m_str>Chinatown</m_str> (14_17) 	<br><blue>12(3)</blue>: <m_str>a Hip</m_str> (13_22) 	<m_str>the Hip</m_str> (14_22) 	<m_str>the Hip</m_str> (20_23) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
