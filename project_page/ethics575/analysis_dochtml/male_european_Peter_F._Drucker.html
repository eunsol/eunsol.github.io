<blue>1</blue>Peter F. Drucker , the political economist and author , whose view that big business and nonprofit enterprises were the defining innovation of the 20th century led him to pioneering social and management theories , died yesterday at his home in Claremont , Calif . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 95 . <br><blue>3</blue>His death was announced by Claremont Graduate University . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Drucker thought of himself , first and foremost , as a writer and teacher , though he eventually settled on the term '' social ecologist . '' <br><blue>5</blue>He became internationally renowned for urging corporate leaders to agree with subordinates on objectives and goals and then get out of the way of decisions about how to achieve them . <br><blue>6</blue>He challenged both business and labor leaders to search for ways to give workers more control over their work environment . <br><blue>7</blue>He also argued that governments should turn many functions over to private enterprise and urged organizing in teams to exploit the rise of a technology-astute class of '' knowledge workers . '' <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Drucker staunchly defended the need for businesses to be profitable but he preached that employees were a resource , not a cost . <br><blue>9</blue>His constant focus on the human impact of management decisions did not always appeal to executives , but they could not help noticing how it helped him foresee many major trends in business and politics . <br><blue>10</blue>He began talking about such practices in the 1940 's and 50 's , decades before they became so widespread that they were taken for common sense . <br><blue>11</blue>Mr. Drucker also foresaw that the 1970 's would be a decade of inflation , that Japanese manufacturers would become major competitors for the United States and that union power would decline . <br><blue>12</blue>For all his insights , he clearly owed much of his impact to his extraordinary energy and skills as a communicator . <br><blue>13</blue>But while Mr. Drucker loved dazzling audiences with his wit and wisdom , his goal was not to be known as an oracle . <br><blue>14</blue>Indeed , after writing a rosy-eyed article shortly before the stock market crash of 1929 in which he outlined why stocks prices would rise , he pledged to himself to stay away from gratuitous predictions . <br><blue>15</blue>Instead , his views about where the world was headed generally arose out of advocacy for what he saw as moral action . <br><blue>16</blue>His first book ( '' The End of Economic Man , '' 1939 ) was intended to strengthen the will of the free world to fight fascism . <br><blue>17</blue>His later economic and social predictions were intended to encourage businesses and social groups to organize in ways that he felt would promote human dignity and vaccinate society against political and economic chaos . '' <br><blue>18</blue>He is remarkable for his social imagination , not his futurism , '' said Jack Beatty in a 1998 review of Mr. Drucker 's work '' The World According to Peter Drucker . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Drucker , who was born in Vienna and never completely shed his Austrian accent , worked in Germany as a reporter until Hitler rose to power and then in a London investment firm before emigrating to the United States in 1937 . <br><blue>20</blue>He became an American citizen in 1943 . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (19_32) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>subordinates on objectives and goals</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (5_30) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>workers more</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (6_18) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (9_25) 	<m_str>His constant focus on the human impact of management decisions</m_str> (9_1) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (9_19) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (10_22) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (10_17) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the human impact of management decisions</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>his impact</m_str> (12_11) 	<br><blue>7(42)</blue>: <m_str>him</m_str> (1_28) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_39) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Drucker</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_18) 	<m_str>the term '' social ecologist</m_str> (4_22) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Drucker</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (9_27) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Drucker</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Drucker</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_26) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (14_29) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_18) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_20) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_10) 	<m_str>Jack Beatty</m_str> (18_15) 	<m_str>Mr. Drucker 's</m_str> (18_22) 	<m_str>According to Peter Drucker</m_str> (18_29) 	<m_str>Mr. Drucker , who was born in Vienna and never completely shed his Austrian accent</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_13) 	<m_str>Hitler</m_str> (19_24) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the world</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>the free world</m_str> (16_22) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>Vienna</m_str> (19_8) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
