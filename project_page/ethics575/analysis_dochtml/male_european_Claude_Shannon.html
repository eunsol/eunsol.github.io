<blue>1</blue>Dr. Claude Elwood Shannon , the American mathematician and computer scientist whose theories laid the groundwork for the electronic communications networks that now lace the earth , died on Saturday in Medford , Mass. , after a long fight with Alzheimer 's disease . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 84 . <br><blue>3</blue>Understanding , before almost anyone , the power that springs from encoding information in a simple language of 1 's and 0 's , Dr. Shannon as a young man wrote two papers that remain monuments in the fields of computer science and information theory . '' <br><blue>4</blue>Shannon was the person who saw that the binary digit was the fundamental element in all of communication , '' said Dr. Robert G. Gallager , a professor of electrical engineering who worked with Dr. Shannon at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . '' <br><blue>5</blue>That was really his discovery , and from it the whole communications revolution has sprung . '' <br><blue>6</blue>Dr. Shannon 's later work on chess-playing machines and an electronic mouse that could run a maze helped create the field of artificial intelligence , the effort to make machines that think . <br><blue>7</blue>And his ability to combine abstract thinking with a practical approach -- he had a penchant for building machines -- inspired a generation of computer scientists . <br><blue>8</blue>Dr. Marvin Minsky of M.I.T. , who as a young theorist worked closely with Dr. Shannon , was struck by his enthusiasm and enterprise . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Whatever came up , he engaged it with joy , and he attacked it with some surprising resource -- which might be some new kind of technical concept or a hammer and saw with some scraps of wood , '' Dr. Minsky said . '' <br><blue>10</blue>For him , the harder a problem might seem , the better the chance to find something new . '' <br><blue>11</blue>Born in Petoskey , Mich. , on April 30 , 1916 , Claude Elwood Shannon got a bachelor 's degree in mathematics and electrical engineering from the University of Michigan in 1936 . <br><blue>12</blue>He got both a master 's degree in electrical engineering and his Ph.D. in mathematics from M.I.T. in 1940 . <br><blue>13</blue>While at M.I.T. , he worked with Dr. Vannevar Bush on one of the early calculating machines , the '' differential analyzer , '' which used a precisely honed system of shafts , gears , wheels and disks to solve equations in calculus . <br><blue>14</blue>Though analog computers like this turned out to be little more than footnotes in the history of the computer , Dr. Shannon quickly made his mark with digital electronics , a considerably more influential idea . <br><blue>15</blue>In what has been described as one of the most important master 's theses ever written , he showed how Boolean logic , in which problems can be solved by manipulating just two symbols , 1 and 0 , could be carried out automatically with electrical switching circuits . <br><blue>16</blue>The symbol 1 could be represented by a switch that was turned on ; 0 would be a switch that was turned off . <br><blue>17</blue>The thesis , '' A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits , '' was largely motivated by the telephone industry 's need to find a mathematical language to describe the behavior of the increasingly complex switching circuits that were replacing human operators . <br><blue>18</blue>But the implications of the paper were far more broad , laying out a basic idea on which all modern computers are built . <br><blue>19</blue>George Boole , the 19th-century British mathematician who invented the two-symbol logic , grandiosely called his system '' The Laws of Thought . '' <br><blue>20</blue>The idea was not lost on Dr. Shannon , who realized early on that , as he once put it , a computer is '' a lot more than an adding machine .
