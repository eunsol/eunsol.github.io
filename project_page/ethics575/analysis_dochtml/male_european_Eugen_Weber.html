<blue>1</blue>Eugen Weber , the Romanian-born , English-educated American historian who was one of the world 's foremost interpreters of modern France and an authority on modern Europe , died Thursday at his home in Los Angeles , where he had taught at U.C.L.A. and was a former dean of its College of Letters and Science . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 82 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was pancreatic cancer , the university said . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Weber 's accessible style made him popular among students , historians and the public in the United States as well as in France , where his books on modern French history are considered classics . <br><blue>5</blue>Over the years , hundreds of thousands of students got their first taste of modern European history from Mr. Weber 's best-selling textbooks like '' A Modern History of Europe '' ( 1971 ) and '' Europe Since 1715 : A Modern History '' ( 1972 ) . <br><blue>6</blue>And he was a familiar , charming presence to Americans who saw his acclaimed 52-part lecture series , '' The Western Tradition , '' produced by WGBH in Boston for public television in 1989 . <br><blue>7</blue>It became the basis of a video instructional series with companion books that students have used ever since . <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Weber wrote about French history and taught it in the United States for more than 40 years . <br><blue>9</blue>He published more than a dozen distinguished books , which have been translated into more than half a dozen languages . <br><blue>10</blue>He was a professor of modern European history at the University of California at Los Angeles , and his classes were so popular that he became a campus celebrity . <br><blue>11</blue>A chair there was endowed in his name . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Weber was encyclopedic in his depiction of an era , a movement or a social trend , focusing more on the many facets of everyday life than on historical theories . <br><blue>13</blue>History , he wrote in '' Europe Since 1715 , '' was '' not just the epic of collective deeds , but the tissue of the times ; not just what happened , but to whom and how ; not just wars and politics , the doings of a relatively restricted group , but the way people lived -- humbler and middling people , and the rich as well -- their food , their housing , the warp and woof of their existence . '' <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Weber 's work was admired in the country that so fascinated him . <br><blue>15</blue>Tony Judt , a professor of history at New York University and a leading writer on French history , once observed : '' On the whole , the French write their own history and write it with much sophistication . <br><blue>16</blue>But occasionally they come across a foreigner who does it differently or better , and then , with much fanfare and generosity , they adopt him for their own . <br><blue>17</blue>Such is the case of Eugen Weber . '' <br><blue>18</blue>At least two of Mr. Weber 's works have become standard reading in France : '' Action Fran√ßaise : Royalism and Reaction in Twentieth-Century France '' ( 1962 ) , a history of the royalist movement , which dominated the French right from the Dreyfus Affair until 1940 ; and '' Peasants Into Frenchmen : The Modernization of Rural France , 1870-1914 '' ( 1976 ) , an account of how a country that was still largely rural , '' inhabited by savages '' and a hodgepodge of cultures was transformed in the half-century after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Weber maintained that before the 20th century , France was largely '' a Parisian political project rather than a national reality . '' <br><blue>20</blue>Modern French identity , he said , was a relatively recent creation , a product of mass education , conscription and the coming of modern communications . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>his acclaimed 52-part lecture series</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>French history</m_str> (8_5) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>Europe</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>Europe</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>Europe</m_str> (5_37) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>the United States as well as in France</m_str> (4_17) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (1_50) 	<m_str>U.C.L.A.</m_str> (1_43) 	<br><blue>6(4)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (16_24) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (16_28) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (15_31) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>France</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>France</m_str> (4_24) 	<m_str>France</m_str> (19_10) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (1_35) 	<m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (10_15) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>their own history</m_str> (15_31) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (15_36) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (16_10) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>the 20th century</m_str> (19_6) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>thousands of students</m_str> (5_7) 	<br><blue>12(4)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (13_71) 	<m_str>the way people</m_str> (13_55) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (13_74) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (13_82) 	<br><blue>13(25)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Weber</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Eugen Weber</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_26) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_32) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_39) 	<m_str>Mr. Weber 's</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_25) 	<m_str>Mr. Weber</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Weber 's</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Weber</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_27) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Weber 's</m_str> (5_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Weber 's</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (14_13) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
