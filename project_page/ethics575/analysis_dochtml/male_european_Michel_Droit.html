'' <br><blue>11</blue>Mr. Droit , whose father was an artist , was born in Vincennes , outside Paris . <br><blue>12</blue>He studied at the prestigious Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques , but he dropped out to join the French Resistance movement against the German Occupation during World War II . <br><blue>13</blue>He went on to be a radio correspondent covering French army units in that war , and he was on hand for General de Gaulle 's arrival at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . <br><blue>14</blue>In later years , Mr. Droit was editor in chief at the French state television organization and served as editor in chief of the literary weekly Figaro Litteraire for a decade . <br><blue>15</blue>He also held posts at the conservative newspaper Le Figaro for 20 years . <br><blue>16</blue>When he was elected to the Academie Francaise , Le Figaro declared that it took courage '' for him to openly call himself reactionary , a partisan of order and of virtue .
