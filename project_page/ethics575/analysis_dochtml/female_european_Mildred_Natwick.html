<blue>1</blue>Mildred Natwick , a versatile actress who created an engaging gallery of eccentric , whimsical and spunky characters in plays , films and television for more than 60 years , died yesterday at her home in Manhattan . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 89 . <br><blue>3</blue>Miss Natwick , a small woman with sharp features and a mischievous manner , was a familiar figure on the Broadway stage , where she appeared in some 40 productions . <br><blue>4</blue>Among other roles , she played an idiosyncratic secretary in George Bernard Shaw 's " Candida , " an extroverted medium in Noel Coward 's " Blithe Spirit " and a shrewish wife in Jean Anouilh 's " Waltz of the Toreadors . " <br><blue>5</blue>The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson , in his review of the Anouilh play in 1957 , characterized her performance as " protean " and one that " rides the whirlwind with a great sweep of venomous extravagance . " <br><blue>6</blue>Miss Natwick 's comic brilliance in Neil Simon 's " Barefoot in the Park " prompted Walter Kerr to acclaim her in 1963 as " the most hilarious woman in the Western hemisphere . " <br><blue>7</blue>She further confirmed her versatility in 1970 in Harold Pinter 's " Landscape " and in 1971 when , at the age of 62 , she made her debut in a singing role in a John Kander-Fred Ebb musical , " 70 , Girls , 70 , " as the disarming leader of a circle of elderly people seeking self-esteem by stealing furs . <br><blue>8</blue>Among Miss Natwick 's films were four directed by John Ford . <br><blue>9</blue>She appeared as a prostitute in " The Long Voyage Home , " a doomed mother in " The Three Godfathers , " a hard-bitten Army wife in " She Wore a Yellow Ribbon " and a sly widow in " The Quiet Man . " <br><blue>10</blue>In a 1990 interview , she praised Ford as a masterly director who needed just a few words to inspire actors and give them the right clue or insight for a scene . <br><blue>11</blue>In contrast , she said , Alfred Hitchcock , in directing the comedy " The Trouble With Harry , " told her and the other actors precisely what he wanted . <br><blue>12</blue>Miss Natwick concentrated her career on Broadway , saying she had always preferred plays to movies because " on the stage , you 're in control for two hours , while in a film , you do bits and pieces , usually out of sequence . " <br><blue>13</blue>She received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her work in the 1967 film version of " Barefoot in the Park . " <br><blue>14</blue>She also received several Tony and Emmy nominations and was awarded an Emmy for " The Snoop Sisters , " a 1973-74 television series in which she and Helen Hayes played successful mystery writers who were obsessed with solving real crimes . <br><blue>15</blue>In an interview in her Park Avenue apartment , she said her main criterion for creating a role was to make a character as inseparable from herself as possible . <br><blue>16</blue>Nearly everything , she remarked , " is hit or miss for a while , until it all comes together . " <br><blue>17</blue>She said her advice to young performers was : " Act every time you get a chance . <br><blue>18</blue>At least in the beginning , go wherever acting is . " <br><blue>19</blue>Miss Natwick , who was called Milly by friends and associates , was born in Baltimore on June 19 , 1905 , to Joseph Natwick , a businessman , and the former Mildred Marion Dawes . <br><blue>20</blue>She graduated from the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore and also from Bennett Junior College in Dutchess County , N.Y. , where she majored in drama . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>Walter Kerr</m_str> (6_17) 	<m_str>The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_10) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Broadway</m_str> (12_7) 	<m_str>Broadway</m_str> (3_21) 	<br><blue>3(42)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_27) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_10) 	<m_str>Natwick 's</m_str> (8_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_12) 	<m_str>Helen Hayes</m_str> (14_29) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_26) 	<m_str>Mildred Natwick , a versatile actress who created an engaging gallery of eccentric , whimsical and spunky characters in plays , films and television for more than 60 years</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_4) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>herself</m_str> (15_27) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_34) 	<m_str>Miss Natwick , a small woman with sharp features and a mischievous manner</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (9_30) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>Miss Natwick , who was called Milly by friends and associates</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>Milly</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (3_25) 	<m_str>Miss Natwick</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_22) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>Anouilh</m_str> (5_14) 	<m_str>you</m_str> (12_23) 	<m_str>Jean Anouilh 's</m_str> (4_35) 	<m_str>Miss Natwick 's</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_20) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_23) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>you</m_str> (12_36) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_21) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_4) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (10_24) 	<m_str>the other actors precisely what he wanted</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>actors</m_str> (10_21) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Baltimore</m_str> (19_16) 	<m_str>Baltimore</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (16_17) 	<m_str>a while</m_str> (16_13) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the stage</m_str> (12_20) 	<m_str>the Broadway stage</m_str> (3_20) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
