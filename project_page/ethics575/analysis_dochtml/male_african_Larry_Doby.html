<blue>1</blue>Larry Doby , who broke the color barrier in the American League in 1947 , three months after Jackie Robinson became the first black in modern major league baseball , died last night at his home in Montclair , N.J . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 79 . <br><blue>3</blue>He had been ill for some time , his son Larry Jr. told The Associated Press . <br><blue>4</blue>Doby , who was promoted to the Cleveland Indians on July 5 , 1947 , eventually became the second black to manage a major league team and became a member of the Hall of Fame . <br><blue>5</blue>But his arrival in the major leagues was overshadowed by Robinson 's debut . '' <br><blue>6</blue>The only difference was that Jackie Robinson got all the publicity , '' Doby later said . '' <br><blue>7</blue>You did n't hear much about what I was going through because the media did n't want to repeat the same story . '' <br><blue>8</blue>Doby was destined to stay in Robinson 's broad shadow for most of his career , and it took a half-century for baseball to fully examine his contributions , which included being named a All-Star seven times in a 13-year playing career in addition to his managerial appointment . <br><blue>9</blue>By 1997 , baseball was honoring not only Robinson but also Doby , who by then had served as special adviser to commissioners and league presidents . <br><blue>10</blue>Lawrence Eugene Doby was born on Dec. 13 , 1923 , in Camden , S.C . <br><blue>11</blue>The son of a semipro baseball player , he was an all-state athlete in football , basketball and baseball at Paterson Eastside High School in New Jersey , then continued his athletic career at Long Island University . <br><blue>12</blue>Doby 's early experiences in relatively integrated northeast New Jersey could not prepare him for the discrimination that awaited him in other places . <br><blue>13</blue>He often spoke of how stunned and embarrassed he was when he arrived for training upon induction into the Navy in 1944 only to be segregated from whites he had played with and even served as captain for on teams while growing up . <br><blue>14</blue>Doby played for the Newark Eagles of the Negro Leagues from 1942 to 1943 and 1946 to 1947 , before and after his military service . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1946 , Doby , a 6-foot-1 , left-handed-hitting second baseman , batted .341 and was an accomplished power hitter . <br><blue>16</blue>That caught the attention of the Indians ' owner , Bill Veeck , who had decided to join the Dodgers ' general manager , Branch Rickey , in breaking the unwritten rule against signing nonwhite players , assuring the integration of both major leagues . <br><blue>17</blue>Doby , who lost his father when he was 8 years old , regarded Veeck , who signed Doby as an infielder , as a second father . '' <br><blue>18</blue>He did n't see color , '' Doby said of Veeck in an interview with The New York Times in 1997 . '' <br><blue>19</blue>To me , he was in every sense , colorblind . <br><blue>20</blue>And I always knew he was there for me . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Indians '</m_str> (16_6) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>the major leagues</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>the Negro Leagues</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>both major leagues</m_str> (16_42) 	<br><blue>3(14)</blue>: <m_str>Jackie Robinson</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>his son Larry Jr.</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>Robinson 's</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>Jackie Robinson</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_27) 	<m_str>Robinson 's</m_str> (8_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_46) 	<m_str>Robinson</m_str> (9_9) 	<br><blue>4(5)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_5) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>the American League</m_str> (1_10) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Hall of Fame</m_str> (4_32) 	<br><blue>7(10)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_31) 	<m_str>The son of a semipro baseball player</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (12_20) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (12_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_29) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_23) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>me</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>me</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>his career</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (8_18) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>.341</m_str> (15_14) 	<m_str>That</m_str> (16_1) 	<br><blue>11(13)</blue>: <m_str>Doby , who was promoted to the Cleveland Indians on July 5 , 1947</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Doby</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>Doby</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Doby</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>Lawrence Eugene Doby</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Doby 's</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>Doby</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Doby , a 6-foot-1 , left-handed-hitting second baseman</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>Doby , who lost his father when he was 8 years old , regarded Veeck , who signed Doby as an infielder , as a second father</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Veeck , who signed Doby as an infielder , as a second father</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>Doby</m_str> (17_19) 	<m_str>Doby</m_str> (18_8) 	<m_str>Veeck</m_str> (18_11) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
