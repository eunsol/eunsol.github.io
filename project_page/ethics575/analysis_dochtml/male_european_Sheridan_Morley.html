<blue>1</blue>Sheridan Morley , the prominent British critic , biographer and broadcaster who devoted his career to chronicling and , often , celebrating plays and players , died on Friday at his home in London . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 65 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause has not yet been determined , but his death was widely reported in the British press . <br><blue>4</blue>A lifelong lover of the theater , Mr. Morley came from thoroughbred theatrical stock . <br><blue>5</blue>The actor Robert Morley was his father , the actress Gladys Cooper was his maternal grandmother , the actor Robert Hardy was his uncle by marriage . <br><blue>6</blue>His godfather and the subject of his finest biography , '' A Talent to Amuse , '' ( 1969 ) was Noël Coward . <br><blue>7</blue>Sheridan Morley was born on Dec. 5 , 1941 , the day his father opened as Sheridan Whiteside , the grotesquely self-absorbed critic , based on Alexander Woolcott , in the West End production of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart 's comedy '' The Man Who Came to Dinner . '' <br><blue>8</blue>It was this , along with Robert Morley 's admiration for the dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan , that explained his unconventional first name , which Mr. Morley preferred to hear reduced to Sherry . <br><blue>9</blue>A large , ebullient figure , Mr. Morley was more introverted than his father , whom he resembled physically . <br><blue>10</blue>His childhood , like his name , was unconventional , much of it dictated by his father 's work and enlivened by encounters with the famous . <br><blue>11</blue>He spent time both in Hollywood , where he recalled witnessing cricket matches between expatriate British actors and watching Greta Garbo help wash the dishes after a game , and New York , where his father starred in his own play , '' Edward , My Son , '' in 1948 . <br><blue>12</blue>But at age 9 Sheridan was sent to a progressive co-educational boarding school in England , spending his holidays wherever Robert Morley was filming . <br><blue>13</blue>He eventually proved a good enough scholar to secure a place at Merton College , Oxford , where he became active in undergraduate theater , which was flourishing . <br><blue>14</blue>At Oxford he first met Ruth Leon , who became his second wife in 1995 . <br><blue>15</blue>But it was during a year teaching at the University of Hawaii that he met his first wife , the Boston-born Margaret Gudejko , to whom he was married from 1965 to 1990 ; the marriage ended in divorce . <br><blue>16</blue>Ms. Leon , a critic and writer , survives , along with a son and two daughters from his first marriage . <br><blue>17</blue>After his year in Hawaii , Mr. Morley , always a confident , articulate speaker , became a late-night newscaster and commentator on British independent television . <br><blue>18</blue>( He covered the lying-in-state of Winston Churchill in 1965 . ) <br><blue>19</blue>He later moved to the BBC , where he was featured on the magazine program '' Late Night Line-Up . '' <br><blue>20</blue>In the 1960s , he also became active as an arts writer , contributing reviews , articles and interviews to The Times of London , among other publications . <br><hr><br><blue>1(6)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>the prominent British critic</m_str> (1_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Morley</m_str> (4_8) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Oxford</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>Oxford</m_str> (14_2) 	<br><blue>3(41)</blue>: <m_str>A lifelong lover of the theater , Mr. Morley</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>The actor Robert Morley</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_6) 	<m_str>the actress Gladys Cooper</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_14) 	<m_str>Robert Hardy</m_str> (5_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_23) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>Sheridan Morley</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Robert Morley 's</m_str> (8_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_20) 	<m_str>Mr. Morley</m_str> (8_26) 	<m_str>Mr. Morley</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_17) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_35) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_39) 	<m_str>Sheridan</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_18) 	<m_str>Robert Morley</m_str> (12_21) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_27) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Morley , always a confident , articulate speaker</m_str> (17_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_5) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (1_34) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Noël Coward</m_str> (6_22) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>the actor Robert Hardy was his uncle by marriage</m_str> (5_18) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>the theater , Mr. Morley</m_str> (4_5) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>the day his father opened as Sheridan Whiteside , the grotesquely self-absorbed critic , based on Alexander Woolcott , in the West End production of George S.
