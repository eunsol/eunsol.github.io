<blue>1</blue>Jeanne S. Chall , a leading expert on how children learn to read and a vociferous antagonist in at least two of the major educational controversies of the last quarter-century , died on Nov. 27 at her home in Cambridge , Mass . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 78 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was heart failure , said Ariadne Valsamis , a spokeswoman for the Harvard Graduate School of Education , where Dr. Chall taught for 26 years , until retiring in 1991 . <br><blue>4</blue>Dr. Chall championed both challenging reading material for children and the use of phonics in basic reading instruction , as against limited-vocabulary texts and the so-called whole-language approach . <br><blue>5</blue>With the argument that easy is not necessarily good , she was a rigorous opponent of the prevailing view of reading specialists in the mid-1970 's that if assigned reading was too difficult , children would become frustrated and give up trying to master it . <br><blue>6</blue>That view , Dr. Chall said , was responsible for a rash of '' cute kiddie books '' with lavish four-color illustrations , limited vocabulary and rudimentary syntax that made few demands on early readers . <br><blue>7</blue>Dr. Chall ( pronounced shawl ) attacked that orthodoxy with scores of books and articles in which she called for challenging primers . <br><blue>8</blue>Dr. Chall pressed her beliefs in a 1977 study that was commissioned by the College Board as part of a project to learn the reasons for a sharp decline since 1962 in average scores on the reading-comprehension part of the SAT . <br><blue>9</blue>Although her report pointed to a number of possible explanations , it found that the scores tended to rise with the level of difficulty of the material students had been given to read from their earliest days in school . <br><blue>10</blue>Dr. Chall engaged in renewed combat in 1983 , when , in the spring issue of Contemporary Education Review , she wrote a blistering review of a scholarly book , '' On Learning to Read '' ( Knopf , 1982 ) , by the psychologists Bruno Bettelheim and Karen Zelan . <br><blue>11</blue>The Bettelheim-Zelan book , which had been almost universally praised by other professional educators , argued that the ability to decode words need not be taught but instead was intuitive , resulting without effort from the reading of imaginative , interesting stories . <br><blue>12</blue>Accordingly , the authors said , the cure for the decline in reading scores was more entertaining and engaging primers . <br><blue>13</blue>Dr. Chall scorned that argument , maintaining that '' comparisons of different beginning-reading methods over the past 70 years have found that methods that teach decoding earlier and more systematically produce better word recognition as well as better reading comprehension . '' <br><blue>14</blue>Dr. Chall also vigorously supported phonics , the method of teaching beginners to read by having them associate certain letters with the sounds those letters represent . <br><blue>15</blue>Many experts have de-emphasized phonics over the last two decades and instead adopted the whole-language approach , in which reading is taught through context rather than recognition of the alphabet . <br><blue>16</blue>But Dr. Chall said her research showed that knowledge of the alphabet and familiarity with the sounds that make up words were crucial . <br><blue>17</blue>She expressed her view in '' Learning to Read : The Great Debate '' ( Harcourt Brace , 1967 ) , recognized as a definitive analysis of reading research . <br><blue>18</blue>Jeanne Stemlicht Chall was born in Poland on Jan. 1 , 1921 , and moved with her family to New York City when she was 7 . <br><blue>19</blue>She became the first member of her family to go to college , graduating cum laude from City College in 1941 . <br><blue>20</blue>She earned both a master 's degree ( 1947 ) and a Ph.D. ( 1952 ) from Ohio State University , and taught at Ohio State , Teachers College of Columbia University and City College before joining the Harvard faculty . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the scores</m_str> (9_15) 	<m_str>average scores</m_str> (8_33) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>her view</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>the prevailing view of reading specialists in the mid-1970 's</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>That view</m_str> (6_1) 	<br><blue>3(18)</blue>: <m_str>She</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Chall</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Chall</m_str> (3_22) 	<m_str>Dr. Chall</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (18_24) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>Dr. Chall</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>Dr. Chall</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Chall</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Chall</m_str> (16_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>Jeanne Stemlicht Chall</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Chall -LRB- pronounced shawl -RRB-</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Chall</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>her family</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>her family to go to college</m_str> (19_7) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (5_45) 	<m_str>assigned reading</m_str> (5_29) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the sounds that make up words</m_str> (16_16) 	<m_str>the sounds those letters represent</m_str> (14_22) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>teaching beginners</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (14_17) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>the authors</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>the material students</m_str> (9_26) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (9_35) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>City College in 1941</m_str> (19_18) 	<m_str>City College</m_str> (20_34) 	<br><blue>10(8)</blue>: <m_str>she</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Jeanne S.
