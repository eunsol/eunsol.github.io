         <h1>Alex Comfort, 80, Dies; a Multifaceted Man Best Known for Writing 'The Joy of Sex' </h1>

 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>Dr. Alex Comfort , whose graphically illustrated 1972 book '' The Joy of Sex '' became the coffee-table Kama Sutra of the baby-boom generation , died on Sunday at a nursing home in Banbury , northwest of London . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 80 . <br><blue>3</blue>Dr. Comfort noisily regretted that his hurriedly written book ( by one account it took two weeks ) , which in its three versions sold more than 12 million copies , so vastly outshone his other accomplishments . <br><blue>4</blue>He was a physician , poet , novelist , scientific researcher , anarchist and pacifist and the author of 51 books . '' <br><blue>5</blue>I do n't want to be known as Dr. Sex , '' he told Publishers Weekly in 1976 . <br><blue>6</blue>But few people now entering middle age can forget the omnipresence of Dr. Comfort 's book , whose original title was '' The Joy of Sex : A Cordon Bleu Guide to Lovemaking , '' which was quickly changed to '' The Joy of Sex : A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking , '' after the owners of the Cordon Bleu name objected . <br><blue>7</blue>The first version was published by Simon &amp; Schuster and the second by Crown , both in 1972 . <br><blue>8</blue>The publisher of the '' The Joy of Cooking '' apparently never objected . <br><blue>9</blue>The book eventually earned him $ 3 million , most of which he gave away . <br><blue>10</blue>It came out at a time when the birth control pill had removed some constraints to sex , and before AIDS added new ones . <br><blue>11</blue>The not-so-fuzzy sketches in the original edition showed a bearded man and his inamorata coupled in all sorts of tangled positions beneath cookbook-like chapter headings like '' Starters , '' '' Main Courses '' and '' Sauces and Pickles . '' <br><blue>12</blue>The book , written by a vigorous pacifist , became the virtual manual for those who wanted to make love , not war . <br><blue>13</blue>And for all his annoyance about the public 's ignorance about his other accomplishments , Dr. Comfort never left any doubt that he saw sex as critically important . <br><blue>14</blue>He suggested that things like the American involvement in Vietnam might be the result of '' uninteresting sex . '' <br><blue>15</blue>The text condemned the prudery of '' squares '' and dispensed advice on '' how to treat a partner who is hip for ' discipline . ' '' <br><blue>16</blue>Advice often seemed as humorous as it was helpful . <br><blue>17</blue>For example , one hint was , '' Never fool around sexually with vacuum cleaners . '' <br><blue>18</blue>The big toe , readers learned , could be a powerful erotic instrument . <br><blue>19</blue>Not much was left out , from G-strings to chastity belts to love positions that might tax a circus contortionist . <br><blue>20</blue>The book 's impact was sometimes likened to that of Dr. Spock 's groundbreaking manual on babies . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (9_5) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>Dr. Comfort 's book , whose original title was '' The Joy of Sex : A Cordon Bleu Guide to Lovemaking , '' which was quickly changed to '' The Joy of Sex : A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking , '' after the owners of the Cordon Bleu name objected</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>The book</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>The book 's</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>a bearded man</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_13) 	<br><blue>4(5)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_35) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_13) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>his other accomplishments</m_str> (3_35) 	<m_str>his other accomplishments</m_str> (13_12) 	<br><blue>6(6)</blue>: <m_str>Dr. Alex Comfort</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (3_14) 	<m_str>Dr. Comfort</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (3_22) 	<m_str>Dr. Comfort 's</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>Dr. Comfort</m_str> (13_16) 	<br><blue>7(4)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>Crown</m_str> (7_14) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Advice</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (16_7) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>AIDS</m_str> (10_21) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
