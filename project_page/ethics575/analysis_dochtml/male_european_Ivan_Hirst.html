<blue>1</blue>Maj. Ivan Hirst , the British Army officer responsible for getting the Volkswagen factory running again after World War II in what is now Wolfsburg , Germany , died March 10 at his home near Marsden , in Yorkshire , England . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 84 . <br><blue>3</blue>Without his efforts , Volkswagen probably could never have shifted from its failed dream of producing a people 's car for the Third Reich into the economic powerhouse that built the Beetle , the symbol of German recovery . '' <br><blue>4</blue>Anyone who drives a VW owes a lot to Major Hirst , '' said Ryan Lee Price , editor of VW Trends magazine , a publication for Beetle owners . <br><blue>5</blue>Ivan Hirst was born March 4 , 1916 , in Saddleworth , England . <br><blue>6</blue>He studied at the University of Manchester and worked for a time in his family 's optical instrument business . <br><blue>7</blue>He turned a youthful interest in motor vehicles into an assignment in the tank repair service for the British Army during the war . <br><blue>8</blue>Part of the Duke of Wellington 's Regiment , he was evacuated at Dunkirk after the fall of France in 1940 . <br><blue>9</blue>Later transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers , he returned to Europe as head of a tank repair group in Brussels . <br><blue>10</blue>It was from there that he was ordered in August 1945 to the former '' Strength Through Joy '' City , a sprawling forced-labor factory between Berlin and Hanover . <br><blue>11</blue>The city was soon renamed Wolfsburg . <br><blue>12</blue>Captured by the Americans , the mile-long , bombed-out plant Hitler had built was then turned over to the British . <br><blue>13</blue>The plant 's last wartime products were parts for V-1 rocket bombs and stoves for soldiers on the Eastern front . <br><blue>14</blue>The work was done by about 15,000 slave laborers , prisoners of war and others . <br><blue>15</blue>Sent to the plant without orders , Major Hirst found the workers still there and on his own initiative decided to use them . <br><blue>16</blue>In his repair and motor pool service , he found fearful ex-Nazi administrators , refugees from the Soviet sector 15 miles to the east and former slave laborers mingled suspiciously in an economy where the prime currency was American cigarettes . <br><blue>17</blue>The slave laborers were soon sent home . <br><blue>18</blue>Major Hirst recalled in a 1962 magazine article that he and his commanding officer , Col. Michael McEvoy , who had driven an early version of the Volkswagen in 1938 , spray-painted army green one of the few Beetles around and drove it to their local headquarters . <br><blue>19</blue>In September 1945 the two officers persuaded the British military to place an order for 20,000 vehicles to serve local troops and officials . <br><blue>20</blue>Without that order the machinery in the plant would probably have been disbursed among the occupying powers and the factory shut forever . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Volkswagen factory</m_str> (1_12) 	<m_str>the factory</m_str> (20_19) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>a VW</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>VW Trends</m_str> (4_21) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (15_23) 	<m_str>the workers</m_str> (15_11) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>the British military</m_str> (19_8) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>the few Beetles around</m_str> (18_37) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (18_43) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (18_45) 	<m_str>the two officers</m_str> (19_4) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Wolfsburg</m_str> (1_25) 	<m_str>Wolfsburg</m_str> (11_6) 	<br><blue>7(18)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_2) 	<m_str>Ivan Hirst</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>Hitler</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>Major Hirst</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_9) 	<m_str>Major Hirst</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_12) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Joy '' City , a sprawling forced-labor factory between Berlin and Hanover</m_str> (10_18) 	<m_str>The city</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>an order for 20,000 vehicles</m_str> (19_13) 	<m_str>that order</m_str> (20_2) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>former slave laborers</m_str> (16_26) 	<m_str>The slave laborers</m_str> (17_1) 	<br><blue>11(3)</blue>: <m_str>the mile-long , bombed-out plant Hitler had built</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>The plant 's</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>the plant</m_str> (20_7) 	<br><blue>12(4)</blue>: <m_str>Volkswagen</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>Volkswagen</m_str> (3_5) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (3_12) 	<m_str>the Volkswagen</m_str> (18_27) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
