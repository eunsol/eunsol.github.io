<blue>1</blue>Claude Nougaro , a popular French singer and songwriter whose fondness for American jazz led him to add swing to the traditional French chanson , died on March 4 at his home here . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 74 . <br><blue>3</blue>Le Monde , the French daily , said the cause was cancer . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Nougaro , who once described himself as a '' Baroque troubadour , '' belonged to a generation of French singers who made their names in the 1950 's and 1960 's and who remained ever loved even as popular French music moved through rock , pop , rap and techno . <br><blue>5</blue>While Mr. Nougaro was relatively unknown abroad , his death brought an outpouring of grief here , not only from the thousands of fans who attended memorial services for him at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris and in his hometown of Toulouse , in southwest France , but also from French politicians and cultural figures . <br><blue>6</blue>President Jacques Chirac described him as a master of French song and added that '' a veritable poet has left us . '' <br><blue>7</blue>The culture minister , Jean-Jacques Aillagon , said Mr. Nougaro had a unique style '' where the poetry of his words and tenderness of his jazz rhythms had a special place . '' <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Nougaro was born in Toulouse on Sept. 9 , 1929 , into a family of musicians . <br><blue>9</blue>His father , Pierre , was an opera singer ; his Italian mother , Liette , was a piano teacher . <br><blue>10</blue>Strangely , however , while at an early age he discovered the music of Bessie Smith , Louis Armstrong and Glenn Miller and the songs of Charles Trenet and Édith Piaf on the radio , he never learned to read music or play an instrument and did not plan a career in entertainment . <br><blue>11</blue>Instead , after doing his military service in the French Foreign Legion in Morocco , he began working as a journalist , writing poetry in his spare time . <br><blue>12</blue>But soon he was also writing lyrics for singers like Piaf , and he even wrote French lyrics to American jazz favorites , including Thelonious Monk 's '' Round Midnight '' and Sonny Rollins 's '' St. Thomas . '' <br><blue>13</blue>When Mr. Nougaro himself began singing in the mid-1950 's , the American influence in his music made it distinct from that of colleagues like Trenet , Charles Aznavour , Juliette Gréco and Yves Montand . <br><blue>14</blue>A stocky , dark-haired man with the physique of a boxer , he also became a fine stage performer , his strong Toulouse accent adding to his appeal to Parisian audiences . '' <br><blue>15</blue>I am a singer of texts who sings with a bit of rhythm , '' he noted some years ago . <br><blue>16</blue>But while his texts provided his raw material , he was above all fascinated with rhythm , that of American jazz but also that of Brazilian music , with its strong African undercurrent . <br><blue>17</blue>Among his Brazilian partners were Baden Powell and Chico Buarque . <br><blue>18</blue>His 20 record albums include a handful of songs that remain popular today , including '' Je Suis Sous '' ( '' I Am Drunk '' ) , '' Cécile , Ma Fille '' ( '' Cecile , My Daughter '' ) , '' Jazz and Java '' and '' Paris Mai , '' which was written after the May 1968 anti-government student demonstrations . <br><blue>19</blue>In the late 1980 's , after his career faltered , he made what became known as his comeback album , '' Nougayork , '' which he recorded in New York . <br><blue>20</blue>In recent years , as his health failed , Mr. Nougaro turned again to his texts , appearing onstage to recite his poetry rather than to sing . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>Toulouse</m_str> (5_43) 	<m_str>Toulouse</m_str> (14_23) 	<m_str>Toulouse</m_str> (8_6) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Cécile</m_str> (18_30) 	<br><blue>3(45)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Nougaro</m_str> (7_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_27) 	<m_str>Mr. Nougaro</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_10) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (1_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_23) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_36) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_26) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Nougaro</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>My</m_str> (18_39) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_27) 	<m_str>Mr. Nougaro</m_str> (20_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Nougaro himself</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_15) 	<m_str>President Jacques Chirac</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_22) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_40) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>popular French music</m_str> (4_40) 	<m_str>his music</m_str> (13_16) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>French singers</m_str> (4_20) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (4_24) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>his texts</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>texts who sings with a bit of rhythm</m_str> (15_6) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>his death</m_str> (5_9) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
