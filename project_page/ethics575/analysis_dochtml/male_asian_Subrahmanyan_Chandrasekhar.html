<blue>1</blue>Dr. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar , a Nobel laureate in physics whose discovery about the evolution of stars pointed toward the existence of " black holes , " died yesterday at the University of Chicago Hospitals . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 84 and lived in Chicago . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was a heart attack , said a spokesman for the University of Chicago . <br><blue>4</blue>Dr. Chandrasekhar , who was born in colonial India and was affiliated with the University of Chicago for 50 years , was the first to postulate the existence of objects so dense that nothing , not even light , could escape them . <br><blue>5</blue>He found that when a star much more massive than the Sun exhausted its fuel it would collapse indefinitely . <br><blue>6</blue>The result is now defined as either a " black hole " or a neutron star . <br><blue>7</blue>In 1983 , for his pioneering work in astrophysics , he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Dr. William Fowler of the California Institute of Technology , who was honored for his study of how the elements were formed . <br><blue>8</blue>Through his calculations in 1930 Dr. Chandrasekhar showed that the collapse of a star like the Sun would end in a highly compact and dense state known as a " white dwarf . " <br><blue>9</blue>But , he said , if its mass was much greater , it would continue to collapse , and " one is left speculating on other possibilities . " <br><blue>10</blue>The critical mass that makes a star too massive to become a " white dwarf , " 1.4 times that of the Sun , is now known as the " Chandrasekhar limit . " <br><blue>11</blue>Speculation by scientists like Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer on what happens to more massive stars led to the concept of black holes with a mass and gravity so strong that no light or anything else could escape . <br><blue>12</blue>Dr. Chandrasekhar , known to students , colleagues and friends as Chandra , was born on Oct. 19 , 1910 , in Lahore , India , which later became part of Pakistan . <br><blue>13</blue>The family had a strong scientific tradition . <br><blue>14</blue>His uncle , Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman , had discovered a form of light scattering known as the Raman effect , for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1930 . <br><blue>15</blue>As a teen-ager Dr. Chandrasekhar proved a brilliant mathematician , but Sir Arthur Eddington 's writing on astrophysics , in addition to a number of unusual observations , turned his attention to astrophysics . <br><blue>16</blue>One was the discovery in orbit around Sirius , brightest star in the sky , of a tiny white companion . <br><blue>17</blue>Its orbital behavior indicated that it was extremely dense . <br><blue>18</blue>Its message , said Eddington , was , " I am composed of material 3,000 times denser than anything you have come across ; a ton of my material would be a little nugget you could put into a matchbox . " <br><blue>19</blue>New telescopes showed that such " white dwarfs " were common . <br><blue>20</blue>By then it had been recognized that atoms were highly compressible but that the gigantic gaseous body of a star was normally supported by radiation from its core . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>its mass</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>The critical mass that makes a star too massive to become a `` white dwarf</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>2(5)</blue>: <m_str>The family</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_24) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_10) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (18_28) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>material 3,000 times denser than anything you have come across</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>my material</m_str> (18_28) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Nobel Prize in Physics</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>a Nobel Prize</m_str> (14_26) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>you</m_str> (18_35) 	<m_str>you</m_str> (18_20) 	<br><blue>6(5)</blue>: <m_str>Its</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>Its</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Its message , said Eddington</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (20_27) 	<br><blue>7(11)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_33) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>Dr. Chandrasekhar</m_str> (8_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>the `` Chandrasekhar</m_str> (10_29) 	<m_str>Dr. Chandrasekhar , known to students , colleagues and friends as Chandra</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Chandrasekhar</m_str> (15_4) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>a brilliant mathematician , but Sir Arthur Eddington 's writing on astrophysics , in addition to a number of unusual observations</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_30) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>the University of Chicago Hospitals</m_str> (1_30) 	<m_str>the University of Chicago</m_str> (3_12) 	<m_str>the University of Chicago</m_str> (4_14) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>a star</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>a star</m_str> (20_19) 	<br><blue>11(6)</blue>: <m_str>the Sun</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (5_14) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>the Sun</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (9_13) 	<br><blue>12(1)</blue>: <m_str>Chicago</m_str> (2_7) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
