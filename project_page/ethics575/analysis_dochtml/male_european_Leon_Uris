<blue>1</blue>Leon Uris , the high school dropout who became a brand-name novelist with his best-selling '' Exodus , '' the 1958 historical pageant about the founding of modern Israel , died on Saturday at his home on Shelter Island , N.Y . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 78 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was renal failure , his former wife , the photographer Jill Uris , said yesterday . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Uris 's fiction , about a dozen novels , was painstakingly researched and compulsively readable , and it mattered little to millions of fans that some critics found it wanting in characterization or literary grace . <br><blue>5</blue>Preparing to write '' Exodus , '' for example , he read nearly 300 books , underwent a physical-training program in preparation for about 12,000 miles of travel within Israel and interviewed more than 1,200 people . '' <br><blue>6</blue>I was tough , '' he told The Associated Press in a 1988 interview looking back on his life . '' <br><blue>7</blue>I used everything to my advantage . <br><blue>8</blue>I could be very ruthless . '' <br><blue>9</blue>The resulting work became an extraordinary best seller . <br><blue>10</blue>By 1965 its American paperback version had already placed among the top 10 New York Times best sellers , with more than five million copies sold by then . <br><blue>11</blue>The hardcover version was on the best-seller list for more than a year , with 19 weeks at No. 1 . <br><blue>12</blue>Reviewing a later novel by Mr. Uris in The New York Times Book Review , Pete Hamill wrote in 1976 : '' Leon Uris is a storyteller , in a direct line from those men who sat around fires in the days before history and made the tribe more human . <br><blue>13</blue>The subject is man , not words ; story is all , the form it takes is secondary . '' <br><blue>14</blue>He continued : '' So it is a simple thing to point out that Uris often writes crudely , that his dialogue can be wooden , that his structure occasionally groans under the excess baggage of exposition and information . <br><blue>15</blue>Simple , but irrelevant . <br><blue>16</blue>None of that matters as you are swept along in the narrative . '' <br><blue>17</blue>What swept Mr. Uris along in his narratives was a passionate determination to work his own experience and that of his European forebears into the historical fabric of his fiction . <br><blue>18</blue>Leon Marcus Uris was born on Aug. 3 , 1924 , in Baltimore , the second child and only son of Wolf William Uris , a shopkeeper , and Anna Blumberg Uris . <br><blue>19</blue>Both his parents were Jews of Russian-Polish origin ; his mother was a first-generation American , and his father was an immigrant from Poland who on his way to America had spent a year in Palestine after World War I and had derived his surname from Yerushalmi , meaning man of Jerusalem . <br><blue>20</blue>After attending public schools in Norfolk , Va. , Baltimore and Philadelphia and making up his mind to become a writer despite being failed three times by one of his English teachers , Mr. Uris quit high school shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor ( he was halfway through his senior year ) and joined the Marine Corps . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>its American paperback version</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>The hardcover version</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>2(27)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (20_48) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_52) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Uris</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_35) 	<m_str>Leon Marcus Uris</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_29) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Uris 's</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_10) 	<m_str>Anna Blumberg Uris</m_str> (18_30) 	<m_str>Mr. Uris in The New York Times Book Review</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_18) 	<m_str>Pete Hamill</m_str> (12_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_27) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>Leon Uris</m_str> (12_23) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_44) 	<m_str>Mr. Uris</m_str> (20_34) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_18) 	<m_str>Uris</m_str> (14_15) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>Baltimore</m_str> (20_10) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (14_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_28) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (20_30) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_16) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (13_15) 	<m_str>The subject</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>The resulting work</m_str> (9_1) 	<br><blue>8(4)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (4_30) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (4_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Uris 's fiction , about a dozen novels</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his fiction</m_str> (17_29) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>Israel</m_str> (5_30) 	<br><blue>10(4)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (7_5) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
