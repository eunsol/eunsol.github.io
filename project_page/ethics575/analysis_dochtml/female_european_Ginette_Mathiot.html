 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>Ginette Mathiot , who taught French cooking to the French with such succinct authority that her basic book of recipes sold more than five million copies , died on June 14 at a retirement home in Paris . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 91 and best known for her 1932 classic , '' I Know How to Cook . '' <br><blue>3</blue>In a country whose vaunted cuisine has been largely the province of men , the title of that book , Miss Mathiot 's first , has a certain ring of defiance , and no wonder . <br><blue>4</blue>Born in Paris in an era when women in France had far fewer career choices than they do today , Miss Mathiot , who was chastising the French cooking establishment as a sexist , male-dominated bastion long after opportunities for women improved , chafed at the restrictions from the beginning . <br><blue>5</blue>If she could n't do anything else , at least she could cook , and if anybody doubted her , it was n't the generations of French homemakers who turned her book into the bible of the French kitchen . <br><blue>6</blue>Raised in an austere household headed by her father , a Protestant minister , she was a brilliant student in secondary school , becoming a disciple of Simone Weil , the ascetic philosopher and mystic . <br><blue>7</blue>But when she expressed an interest in studying medicine , she was persuaded instead to take teaching courses at the Sorbonne and eventually to specialize in the French version of home economics as a more appropriate outlet for a woman than medicine . <br><blue>8</blue>She rose to the top of her academic field , becoming an inspector general in the French homemaking academy before French education authorities withdraw recognition of homemaking as an academic discipline . <br><blue>9</blue>By her own account Miss Mathiot garnered a total of seven marriage proposals but her father rejected each of her suitors on religious grounds ( none were Protestant ) and although Miss Mathiot considered rebelling , in the end , she said , she found she could n't and bowed to her family 's wishes . <br><blue>10</blue>After she established a life and career away from her family , the proposals kept coming , but Miss Mathiot continued to reject them , she said , though for reasons of her own . <br><blue>11</blue>If it was a father 's stern will that forced her to become a home economics teacher , it was another man 's inspired whim -- and a bit of luck -- that led her from the backwaters of education to the front burner of French cuisine . <br><blue>12</blue>While Miss Mathiot was still studying to be a teacher at the Paris Training School of Homemaking at the beginning of the Depression , Albin Michel , a portly French publisher , decided that a cook book emphasizing nutrition might help his ailing business , not to mention his waistline , by appealing to what he perceived as a broad public fascination with the developments of modern science , including advances in nutritional understanding . <br><blue>13</blue>When leading authorities on French cuisine turned him down , Mr. Michel proposed the project to the head of a local college 's science department , who also turned him down but set off a chain of recommendations that finally led Mr. Michel to the 23-year-old Miss Mathiot , who said yes . <br><blue>14</blue>Her book , which included 2,000 recipes covering the canon of French cuisine from lobster bisque to crepe suzette , was an immediate sensation and paved the way for sequels , among them books on bread , pastry and even camping-trips cooking . <br><blue>15</blue>In addition to emphasizing nutrition , Miss Mathiot 's books appealed to family cooks because they showed how to keep food costs down while remaining true to the spirit of French cooking . <br><blue>16</blue>Like '' The Joy of Cooking '' in the United States , '' I Know How to Cook '' and other Mathiot books served as primers for novice cooks , leading readers from the basics of food preparation through simple recipes to more elaborate concoctions . <br><blue>17</blue>A woman who presided over what she saw as a kitchen with millions of stoves , Miss Mathiot , who leaves no immediate survivors , never took anything for granted . <br><blue>18</blue>Anyone following a cake recipe , for example , might think the end had been reached with the instruction to remove the cake from the oven , but Miss Mathiot , mindful of the distractions of a triumphant moment , would have one more instruction : turn off the oven . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the oven</m_str> (18_49) 	<m_str>the oven</m_str> (18_25) 	<br><blue>2(37)</blue>: <m_str>Ginette Mathiot , who taught French cooking to the French
