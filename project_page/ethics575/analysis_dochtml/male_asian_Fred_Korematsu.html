<blue>1</blue>Fred T. Korematsu , who lost a Supreme Court challenge in 1944 to the wartime internment of Japanese-Americans but gained vindication decades later when he was given the Medal of Freedom , died on Wednesday in Larkspur , Calif . <br><blue>2</blue>Mr. Korematsu , who lived in San Leandro , Calif. , was 86 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was a respiratory ailment , said Don Tamaki , a lawyer for Mr. Korematsu . <br><blue>4</blue>When he was arrested in 1942 for failing to report to an internment center , Mr. Korematsu was working as a welder and simply hoping to be left alone so he could pursue his marriage plans . <br><blue>5</blue>He became a central figure in the controversy over the wartime removal of more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans and Japanese immigrants from the West Coast to inland detention centers . <br><blue>6</blue>He emerged as a symbol of resistance to government authority . <br><blue>7</blue>When President Bill Clinton presented Mr. Korematsu with the Medal of Freedom , the nation 's highest civilian award , in January 1998 , the president likened him to Linda Brown and Rosa Parks in the civil rights struggles of the 1950 's . <br><blue>8</blue>In February 1942 , two months after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order authorizing the designation of military areas from which anyone could be excluded '' as protection against espionage and sabotage . '' <br><blue>9</blue>In May 1942 , the military command on the West Coast ordered that all people with Japanese ancestry be removed inland , considering them a security threat , and internment camps were built in harsh and isolated regions . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Korematsu , a native of Oakland , Calif. , and one of four sons of Japanese-born parents , was jailed on May 30 , 1942 , in San Leandro , having refused to join family members who had reported to a nearby racetrack that was being used as a temporary detention center . <br><blue>11</blue>Mr. Korematsu had undergone plastic surgery in an effort to disguise his Asian features and had altered his draft registration card , listing his name as Clyde Sarah and his background as Spanish-Hawaiian . <br><blue>12</blue>He hoped that with his altered appearance and identity he could avoid ostracism when he married his girlfriend , who had an Italian background . <br><blue>13</blue>A few days after his arrest , Mr. Korematsu was visited in jail by a California official of the American Civil Liberties Union who was seeking a test case against internment . <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Korematsu agreed to sue . '' <br><blue>15</blue>I did n't feel guilty because I did n't do anything wrong , '' he told The New York Times four decades later . '' <br><blue>16</blue>Every day in school , we said the pledge to the flag , ' with liberty and justice for all , ' and I believed all that . <br><blue>17</blue>I was an American citizen , and I had as many rights as anyone else . '' <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Korematsu maintained that his constitutional rights were violated by internment and that he had suffered racial discrimination . <br><blue>19</blue>In the summer of 1942 , he was found guilty in federal court of ignoring the exclusion directive and was sentenced to five years ' probation . <br><blue>20</blue>He spent two years at an internment camp in Utah with his family . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (9_24) 	<m_str>all people with Japanese ancestry</m_str> (9_14) 	<br><blue>2(6)</blue>: <m_str>Don Tamaki , a lawyer for Mr. Korematsu</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_31) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_34) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>Supreme Court</m_str> (1_8) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Larkspur , Calif.</m_str> (1_37) 	<m_str>Calif.</m_str> (2_10) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the president</m_str> (7_25) 	<m_str>President Bill Clinton</m_str> (7_2) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>San Leandro</m_str> (2_7) 	<m_str>San Leandro</m_str> (10_29) 	<br><blue>7(30)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Korematsu</m_str> (3_15) 	<m_str>Mr. Korematsu</m_str> (4_16) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>Mr. Korematsu</m_str> (7_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Korematsu , a native of Oakland , Calif. , and one of four sons of Japanese-born parents</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_30) 	<m_str>Mr. Korematsu</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Korematsu</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Korematsu</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_15) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (16_24) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Korematsu</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_12) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>a test case against internment</m_str> (13_27) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>internment</m_str> (13_31) 	<m_str>internment</m_str> (18_11) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the West Coast</m_str> (5_22) 	<m_str>the West Coast</m_str> (9_9) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
