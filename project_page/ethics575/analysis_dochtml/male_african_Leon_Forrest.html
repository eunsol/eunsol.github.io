<blue>1</blue>Leon Forrest , a writer who explored black American history in his richly complex , epic novels , died on Thursday at Evanston Hospital in Evanston , Ill . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 60 and lived in Evanston . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , said his agent , Faith Childs . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Forrest , who had taught African-American studies and English at Northwestern University for the last 24 years , was the author of four novels , as well as plays and essays . <br><blue>5</blue>He had recently completed a collection of novellas that has yet to be published , Ms. Childs said . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Forest was perhaps best known for his last novel , '' Divine Days '' ( 1993 ) , a 1,138-page narrative about seven days in 1966 on the South Side of Chicago . <br><blue>7</blue>In it he mixed several genres , including the parable , tall tale and philosophical argument , to evoke a world inhabited by everyone from politicians and preachers to retired redcaps . <br><blue>8</blue>Writing in The New York Times Book Review , Stanley Crouch described '' Divine Days '' as '' an adventurous masterwork that provides our literature with a signal moment . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Forrest , the reviewer wrote , developed '' an intricate antiphony between things specific to the South Side of Chicago and universal themes like transcendence , the irresponsible uses of the charismatic , the heartbreak of the doomed romance , the riotous absurdity of human circumstances and the reincarnation of individuals and eras . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Forrest pursued many of the same themes in his three other novels , '' There Is a Tree More Ancient Than Eden '' ( 1973 ) , '' The Bloodworth Orphans '' ( 1977 ) and '' Two Wings to Veil My Face '' ( 1983 ) . <br><blue>11</blue>Those novels , which were edited by Toni Morrison , were known as the Forest County Trilogy . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Forrest was born in Chicago in 1937 ; his father worked as a bartender , a job the author would later hold while taking courses at the University of Chicago . <br><blue>13</blue>His upbringing on the South Side , which included influences ranging from the Baptist and Roman Catholic Churches to the blues and jazz , would later be reflected in his writing style , which critics characterized as musical and multilayered , though sometimes overwrought . <br><blue>14</blue>He studied journalism and creative writing at Wilson Junior College and Roosevelt University in Chicago until he was drafted into the Army . <br><blue>15</blue>After serving in Germany , Mr. Forrest worked for several newspapers in Chicago , including the Nation of Islam 's '' Muhammad Speaks . '' <br><blue>16</blue>He was the last non-Muslim top editor at the publication . <br><blue>17</blue>In 1973 , Mr. Forrest joined Northwestern 's creative writing and literature staff . <br><blue>18</blue>In 1985 , the university named him chairman of its department of African-American studies . <br><blue>19</blue>Known primarily for his novels , Mr. Forrest published a collection of essays in 1994 , '' Relocations of the Spirit , '' in which he discussed William Faulkner and Ralph Ellison , in addition to the Black Muslims and Michael Jordan . <br><blue>20</blue>He is survived by his wife , Marianne ; a stepson , James Claude Holt ; a stepdaughter , Peggie Holt Price , and two grandsons . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>four novels , as well as plays and essays</m_str> (4_24) 	<m_str>his three other novels</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>Those novels , which were edited by Toni Morrison</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>1973</m_str> (10_26) 	<m_str>1973</m_str> (17_2) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>his richly complex , epic novels , died on Thursday at Evanston Hospital in Evanston , Ill.</m_str> (1_12) 	<m_str>his novels</m_str> (19_4) 	<br><blue>4(28)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>his agent , Faith Childs</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Forest</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_3) 	<m_str>Stanley Crouch</m_str> (8_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Forrest</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>My</m_str> (10_43) 	<m_str>Mr. Forrest</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Forrest</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_30) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Forrest</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Forrest</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (18_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Forrest</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_26) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_5) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>Chicago</m_str> (9_21) 	<m_str>Chicago</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>Chicago</m_str> (14_15) 	<m_str>Chicago</m_str> (15_13) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Evanston</m_str> (1_26) 	<m_str>Evanston</m_str> (2_7) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the South Side</m_str> (6_29) 	<m_str>the South Side</m_str> (13_4) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>Roosevelt University</m_str> (14_12) 	<m_str>the university</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (18_10) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
