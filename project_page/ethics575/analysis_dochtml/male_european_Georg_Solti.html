<blue>1</blue>Sir Georg Solti , the vigorous and exacting Hungarian-born conductor who shaped the Chicago Symphony Orchestra into a gleaming virtuoso instrument during his 22 years as its music director , and who won more Grammy Awards than any other performer , classical or pop , died yesterday while visiting Antibes , in the south of France , reported Agence France-Presse . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 84 and lived in London . <br><blue>3</blue>Sir Georg had suffered a heart attack on Tuesday while vactioning with his wife , Valerie , and a daughter , Claudia , and died peacefully in his sleep last night , according to Mary Lou Falcone , his press representative in New York . <br><blue>4</blue>In addition to his Chicago post , which he relinquished in 1991 , Sir Georg was music director of the Royal Opera at Covent Garden for a decade starting in 1961 , chief conductor of the Orchestre de Paris from 1970 to 1975 , principal conductor of the London Philharmonic from 1979 to 1983 ( later conductor emeritus ) and director of the Salzburg Easter Festival starting in 1992 . <br><blue>5</blue>He was made a Knight Commander of the British Empire in 1972 . <br><blue>6</blue>On the podium , Sir Georg was full of energy and color . <br><blue>7</blue>Of medium height , trim and bald , he tended to sweep into a big Romantic symphony with angular , slashing gestures that could be taken either as pure showmanship or as a way of drawing on an orchestra 's full reserve of energy . <br><blue>8</blue>On a few occasions he got so carried away during a performance that he injured himself with his baton . <br><blue>9</blue>One of his biographers , William Barry Furlong , wrote in '' Season With Solti : A Year in the Life of the Chicago Symphony '' that at times the conductor '' looks like nothing so much as a spastic stork , bending and rearing convulsively , elbows pumping , knees popping , torso laboring until it seems almost as if he is going to tear the music from himself in a Dionysian frenzy . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Some critics and listeners found Sir Georg 's kinetic approach mesmerizing ; others found it graceless . <br><blue>11</blue>But there was no doubt that it communicated his musical vision to the orchestras he conducted . <br><blue>12</blue>As a guest conductor he worked with virtually all the world 's major orchestras and opera companies . <br><blue>13</blue>Starting in the 1970 's , he occasionally took on a teaching project , including master classes at the Juilliard School , conducting workshops in Chicago and a workshop for young orchestral musicians from all over the United States at Carnegie Hall in 1994 . <br><blue>14</blue>He also began a concert series in London in 1995 , in which he underwrote the costs of Wigmore Hall debut recitals for young musicians . <br><blue>15</blue>On the Value Of Recordings Sir Georg was the very model of a modern conductor . <br><blue>16</blue>He knew that recordings were essential , and in the studio he was efficient enough to turn out hundreds of them and artful enough to keep a grip on listeners ' attention , even in the most frequently recorded repertory . <br><blue>17</blue>His landmark recording of Wagner 's '' Ring des Nibelungen '' was not only the first integral studio recording of the cycle , but was also an audio spectacular that set the standard for the use of effects and spatial placement . <br><blue>18</blue>More than many of his colleagues , Sir Georg insisted that the precision and bright coloration that could be achieved in the recording studio could be duplicated in the concert hall . <br><blue>19</blue>Particularly during his Chicago years , he prized a sizzling brass sound and a rich string tone that could be thrilling in Bruckner and Mahler , and that also served him well in Beethoven and Mozart . '' <br><blue>20</blue>The central feature of the Solti-Chicago success , '' wrote James R. Oestreich in The New York Times in 1991 , just before Sir Georg 's final concerts as music director of the Chicago Symphony , '' was the sheer stunning quality of the playing , which few other groups could rival . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Solti</m_str> (9_15) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Chicago Symphony Orchestra</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (1_27) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>recordings</m_str> (16_4) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (16_21) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Wagner 's</m_str> (17_5) 	<br><blue>5(37)</blue>: <m_str>Sir Georg</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_12) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_23) 	<m_str>Sir Georg</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>Sir Georg</m_str> (18_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_28) 	<m_str>Sir Georg</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_39) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (19_31) 	<m_str>Mozart</m_str> (19_36) 	<m_str>Sir Georg</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>Sir Georg 's</m_str> (20_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>Sir Georg 's</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_62) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (9_70) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_14) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the recording studio</m_str> (18_22) 	<m_str>the studio</m_str> (16_10) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>Beethoven and Mozart</m_str> (19_34) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (4_49) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (2_7) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>last night</m_str> (3_30) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (13_37) 	<br><blue>11(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>Sir Georg 's kinetic approach mesmerizing</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (10_15) 	<br><blue>12(4)</blue>: <m_str>Chicago</m_str> (9_24) 	<m_str>Chicago</m_str> (13_26) 	<m_str>Chicago</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>Chicago</m_str> (4_5) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
