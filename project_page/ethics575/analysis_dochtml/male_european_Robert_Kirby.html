<blue>1</blue>Robert E. Kirby , a former chief executive of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation who masterminded a turnaround of the company in the 1970 's , died last Thursday at Naples Community Hospital in Naples , Fla . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 80 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Kirby , who retired from the company in 1983 , suffered several strokes , a Westinghouse spokesman said . <br><blue>4</blue>Since 1993 , Mr. Kirby had also suffered from Guillain-Barre syndrome , the nerve disorder . <br><blue>5</blue>When Mr. Kirby became chief executive and chairman of Westinghouse in 1975 , it was the 36th-largest corporation and the largest supplier of nuclear power plants in the nation . <br><blue>6</blue>But the company , based in Pittsburgh , was in an earnings slump , was burdened by several money-losing operations it had acquired the previous decade , had poor internal financial controls and had little in the way of strategic planning . <br><blue>7</blue>With the company 's future in doubt , Mr. Kirby orchestrated a sweeping reorganization that included shedding some acquisitions , strengthening internal control systems and returning the company to its core electrical and industrial businesses . <br><blue>8</blue>As a result , the company 's profits increased to $ 223 million in 1977 from $ 28 million in 1974 . <br><blue>9</blue>By 1981 , the company 's turnaround was completed , and Westinghouse reported earnings of $ 403 million and began buying new assets rather than shedding old ones . <br><blue>10</blue>One main acquisition was the $ 646 million purchase of Teleprompter , then one of the nation 's largest cable television operations . <br><blue>11</blue>That deal doubled the size of Westinghouse and positioned it for its later decision to become a communications company . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Kirby 's nine-year tenure in the top position at Westinghouse was also marked by difficulties in the company 's uranium supply contract business , which led to several legal entanglements that Mr. Kirby took charge of negotiating . <br><blue>13</blue>With uranium prices falling in 1975 , the company argued that it was not obligated to fulfill uranium supply contracts that would have cost it more than $ 2 billion . <br><blue>14</blue>A flurry of lawsuits by Westinghouse customers were settled a few years later at a price to Westinghouse of about $ 600 million , substantially below what it would have cost the company to fulfill the contracts . <br><blue>15</blue>Later , the company also settled suits it had filed against what it called a cartel of uranium producers . <br><blue>16</blue>Mr. Kirby was born in Ames , Iowa , on Nov. 8 , 1918 , and grew up in State College , Pa. , where his father was a professor of plant pathology at Pennsylvania State University . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Kirby and his father assisted in the first filming of Penn State football games at Beaver Stadium . <br><blue>18</blue>After receiving a bachelor 's degree in chemical engineering from Penn State in 1939 , Mr. Kirby took a job with the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company in Tyrone , Pa. , and within a year became assistant superintendent of the mill . <br><blue>19</blue>In 1943 , he joined the Navy 's highly secret radar corps . <br><blue>20</blue>He was sent to study electrical engineering at Princeton University , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Bell Labs and was discharged in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant after serving as an electronics officer . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>the size of Westinghouse</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (11_12) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the company 's turnaround</m_str> (9_4) 	<m_str>a turnaround of the company in</m_str> (1_16) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>1946</m_str> (20_24) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the company , based in Pittsburgh</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (6_21) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>his father</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>his father</m_str> (16_26) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>Pennsylvania State University</m_str> (16_35) 	<m_str>Penn State</m_str> (17_12) 	<m_str>Penn State</m_str> (18_11) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>A flurry of lawsuits by Westinghouse customers</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_28) 	<br><blue>8(15)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Kirby</m_str> (7_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Kirby</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Kirby</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Kirby</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_26) 	<m_str>Mr. Kirby 's</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Kirby</m_str> (12_33) 	<m_str>Mr. Kirby</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Robert E.
