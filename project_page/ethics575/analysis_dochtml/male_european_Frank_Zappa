<blue>1</blue>Frank Zappa , a composer , guitarist , band leader and producer who was rock 's most committed iconoclast , died Saturday evening at his home in Los Angeles . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 52 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was prostate cancer , The Associated Press reported . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Zappa was a quintessential 20th-century American composer , a maverick within popular music and an outsider among classical composers . <br><blue>5</blue>His huge body of work -- more than 60 albums since 1966 -- embraces doo-wop , big-band suites , heavy metal , jazz-rock , blues-rock , orchestral music and every pop fad he decided to mock . <br><blue>6</blue>The stage shows of his band , the Mothers of Invention ( renamed Zappa after 1978 ) , were renowned for precise musicianship and uninhibited , sometimes scatological humor . <br><blue>7</blue>His classical chamber and orchestral compositions have been conducted by Zubin Mehta and Pierre Boulez , and the Lyons Opera Ballet of France commissioned choreographers to create dances to his music . <br><blue>8</blue>But as his instrumental music gained recognition , he gave up classical composition , he wrote in his 1989 autobiography , " The Real Frank Zappa Book " ( Poseidon Press ) , because " the incentive to continue was removed by having to deal with symphony orchestras . " <br><blue>9</blue>A Study in Contradictions Mr. Zappa 's work was uneven . <br><blue>10</blue>He was praised for his sweeping eclecticism and his idiosyncratic balance between absolute control and a Dada esque celebration of the repressed . <br><blue>11</blue>At the same time , his pieces were widely criticized for juvenile humor and for a cold , mechanical quality . <br><blue>12</blue>From the beginning , he was an accomplished user of recording technology , creating sonic montages in the studio , and taping and filming many of his performances . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Zappa was an angry satirist , and some of his songs were topical and perishable . <br><blue>14</blue>But even as his targets changed , his work through the years shows a consistent anger at complacency , inhibitions , slipshod thinking and self-delusion , inside and outside popular music , whether he was attacking hippie optimism on " We 're Only in It for the Money " in 1967 or the censorious Parents ' Music Resource Center on " Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention " in 1985 . <br><blue>15</blue>His bands , the Mothers of Invention and Zappa , were schools for musicians . <br><blue>16</blue>Mr. Zappa demanded hyperfast execution , as well as the ability to improvise and to shift idioms in a split-second . <br><blue>17</blue>Former sidemen include the guitarist Lowell George and the bassist Roy Estrada , who founded Little Feat ; Adrian Belew , who went on to play guitar with David Bowie , Talking Heads and King Crimson ; Terry Bozzio , the drummer who founded Missing Persons , and the guitarist Steve Vai . <br><blue>18</blue>In 1982 , the single " Valley Girl " introduced Mr. Zappa 's daughter Moon Unit , who made California slang nationally known . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Zappa himself was a distinctive guitarist , playing solos that moved in irregular , conversational fits and starts . <br><blue>20</blue>In 1981 , recognizing the interest in his guitar solos , he released " Shut Up 'n' Play Yer Guitar , " a three-album project . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the guitarist</m_str> (17_49) 	<m_str>the guitarist Lowell George</m_str> (17_4) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Invention</m_str> (15_7) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (1_28) 	<br><blue>4(37)</blue>: <m_str>His</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>Zubin Mehta</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>Pierre Boulez</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>Zappa</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_34) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Zappa</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_30) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>Contradictions Mr. Zappa 's</m_str> (9_4) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_25) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>`` Frank Zappa</m_str> (14_61) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Zappa 's</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Zappa 's daughter Moon Unit , who made California slang nationally known</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Zappa himself</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Zappa</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Zappa</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_27) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>Zappa</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_33) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>orchestral music</m_str> (5_27) 	<m_str>his instrumental music</m_str> (8_3) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
