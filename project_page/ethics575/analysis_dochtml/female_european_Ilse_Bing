<blue>1</blue>Ilse Bing , one of the few surviving members of the fabled group of avant-garde artists who gathered in Paris in the early 1930 's and produced brilliantly unorthodox and inventive photography , died Tuesday at St. Luke 's - Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 98 and lived on the Upper West Side . <br><blue>3</blue>Susan Arthur Whitson , director of the Edwynn Houk Gallery , which represents her work , said that the gallery had hoped that Ms. Bing would attend the March 26 opening of a retrospective of her work titled '' Ilse Bing : Vision of a Century . '' <br><blue>4</blue>She would have been 99 on March 23 . <br><blue>5</blue>Born into an affluent bourgeois family in Frankfurt , Ms. Bing was trained in music and art . <br><blue>6</blue>It was while she was pursuing a doctorate in art history and photographing buildings for her dissertation that she developed a passion for photography . <br><blue>7</blue>In early 1929 she began to do picture essays for the weekly supplement of a Frankfurt newspaper , becoming one of the few women to work in photojournalism at the time . <br><blue>8</blue>She soon abandoned her studies to become an artist and decided to leave for Paris in the summer of 1929 after seeing an exhibition of photographs by the Paris-based Florence Henri , who had embraced New Photography , which was characterized by extreme close-ups , unusual angles , high and low vantage points , and the rendering of everyday objects and reflected surfaces as abstract geometric forms . <br><blue>9</blue>Paris in the 1920 's and 30 's was home to modernists like Henri , who saw photography as the medium to revolutionize visual language in everything from photojournalism and commercial advertising to fashion and book illustration . <br><blue>10</blue>Working intuitively and with no regard for conventional composition or subject matter , these modern photographers were above all entranced by the new sensations of urban living . <br><blue>11</blue>The only professional photographer in Paris in the 30 's to work exclusively with the Leica , Ms. Bing mastered the use of this small camera as well as darkroom techniques to show the subtleties of light and movement against the inky blacks of Paris at night . <br><blue>12</blue>She favored the overhead shots and tilted angles of German Constructivists , but her photographs are often infused with the softer , more lyrical and humanistic qualities found in the work of many French photographers . <br><blue>13</blue>Like Andre Kertesz and Henri Cartier-Bresson , she caught the spare , lovely geometries in ordinary Parisian life . <br><blue>14</blue>She photographed nighttime Paris , using available light and producing images that were studies of light and deep shadow . <br><blue>15</blue>Accidentally in the darkroom , and independently of Man Ray , she discovered a way to solarize the negative instead of the print , giving the image black outlines created from the controlled use of light during printing . <br><blue>16</blue>Her solarized images of street scenes , especially at night , are magical coaxings of many shades of gray out of darkness . <br><blue>17</blue>Ms. Bing worked for magazines like Vu , Arts et Metiers Graphiques and Le Monde Illustre . <br><blue>18</blue>She did fashion assignments for Harper 's Bazaar and Schiaparelli . <br><blue>19</blue>Her photographs were regularly shown during the 30 's at La Pleiade gallery in Paris , alongside the work of other members of the photographic avant-garde . <br><blue>20</blue>In 1936 , she was included in the first modern photography exhibition held at the Louvre . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Her photographs</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>her photographs</m_str> (12_14) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>1936</m_str> (20_2) 	<br><blue>3(6)</blue>: <m_str>Paris</m_str> (11_6) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (19_15) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (1_20) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (8_15) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (11_45) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (9_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>night</m_str> (11_47) 	<m_str>night</m_str> (16_10) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>the first modern photography exhibition held at the Louvre</m_str> (20_8) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>Manhattan</m_str> (1_45) 	<br><blue>7(15)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (3_14) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Bing</m_str> (3_24) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>Ms. Bing</m_str> (11_18) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_36) 	<m_str>Ilse Bing</m_str> (3_40) 	<m_str>Ms. Bing</m_str> (5_10) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Bing</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_16) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_19) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_4) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Frankfurt</m_str> (7_16) 	<m_str>Frankfurt</m_str> (5_8) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>photography</m_str> (9_18) 	<m_str>photography</m_str> (6_24) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>the image</m_str> (15_26) 	<br><blue>11(9)</blue>: <m_str>Her</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_12) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_14) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
