<blue>1</blue>Charles R. Dawson , a longtime chemistry professor at Columbia University who played the leading role in the discovery of the toxic compounds in poison ivy , died on Wednesday in a hospital in Wolfeboro , N.H . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 88 and lived in Wolfeboro . <br><blue>3</blue>Dr. Dawson taught at Columbia from 1939 until he retired in 1979 . <br><blue>4</blue>In 1940 , he and Dr. David Wasserman , a Columbia graduate student then , began to carry out experiments involving poison ivy . <br><blue>5</blue>They collected 80 pounds of poison ivy bark , from which they extracted two teaspoons of the poisonous oil . <br><blue>6</blue>The oil was used in preliminary chemical experiments , and then the scientists began work on developing methods of synthesizing compounds similar to those found in poison ivy oil . <br><blue>7</blue>In 1948 , Dr. Dawson told reporters that he and Dr. Wasserman had developed a synthetic compound resembling the chemical structure of poison ivy and producing the same physiological effects . <br><blue>8</blue>At that time , the compound , which was considered better than poison ivy as an aid in the diagnosis and possible treatment of the effects of contact with the plant , was being tested by Dr. Harry Keil of the Skin and Center Unit of the New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital . <br><blue>9</blue>In 1953 , it was announced that Professor Dawson and his research students had isolated the toxic agent in the sap of poison ivy and had broken it down into four distinct parts . <br><blue>10</blue>Dr. Dawson 's son , John , a chemistry professor at the University of South Carolina , said yesterday that the least toxic of the four was one of a family of chemical compounds , alkyl catechols , which cause allergic responses in most people if they touch the skin . <br><blue>11</blue>With researchers from the National Institutes of Health , Charles Dawson set about trying to discover a treatment or vaccine based on that least-toxic compound . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1955 , tests carried out at the University of Pennsylvania on a vaccine developed by Dr. Dawson for the prevention of the adverse effects of poison ivy were reported to have been successful . <br><blue>13</blue>Thousands of volunteers had submitted to a series of injections intended to desensitize them to poison ivy . <br><blue>14</blue>In 1956 , it was reported that the poison ivy vaccine , which could be taken orally or injected , would soon be on the market . <br><blue>15</blue>John Dawson said that it was his understanding that the vaccine had been on the market for some years and that eventually it had been supplanted as the chief anti-poison-ivy treatment by steroid-based anti-inflammatory ointments . <br><blue>16</blue>Charles Dawson was born in Peterboro , N.H . <br><blue>17</blue>He received a bachelor 's degree in 1933 and a master 's degree in chemistry in 1935 , both from the University of New Hampshire , and a doctorate in 1938 from Columbia . <br><blue>18</blue>In addition to his son , Dr. Dawson is survived by his wife , Dorothea Lockard ; a daughter , Patricia Dawson Runner of Tiverton , R.I. ; seven grandchildren ; a sister , Ruth Taylor of Boise , Idaho , and a brother , Robert , of Leeds , Me . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the poisonous oil</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>The oil</m_str> (6_1) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>Columbia University</m_str> (1_10) 	<m_str>Columbia</m_str> (3_5) 	<m_str>Columbia</m_str> (4_11) 	<m_str>Columbia</m_str> (17_33) 	<br><blue>3(4)</blue>: <m_str>a Columbia graduate student</m_str> (4_10) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>the scientists</m_str> (6_12) 	<br><blue>4(5)</blue>: <m_str>a vaccine developed by Dr. Dawson for the prevention of the adverse effects of poison ivy</m_str> (12_13) 	<m_str>the poison ivy vaccine , which could be taken orally or injected</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (15_23) 	<m_str>the vaccine</m_str> (15_10) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the compound , which was considered better than poison ivy as an aid in the diagnosis and possible treatment of the effects of contact with the plant</m_str> (8_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (9_4) 	<br><blue>6(5)</blue>: <m_str>poison ivy</m_str> (7_23) 	<m_str>poison ivy</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>poison ivy</m_str> (9_23) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (9_28) 	<m_str>poison ivy</m_str> (12_27) 	<br><blue>7(19)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Dawson</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_9) 	<m_str>Dr. Dawson</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>Professor Dawson</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>the toxic agent in the</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>Dr. Dawson 's</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Charles Dawson</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>Dr. Dawson for the prevention of the adverse effects of poison ivy</m_str> (12_17) 	<m_str>John Dawson</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>Charles Dawson</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>Dr. Dawson</m_str> (18_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_12) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Skin</m_str> (8_41) 	<m_str>the skin</m_str> (10_49) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (13_14) 	<m_str>Thousands of volunteers</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>Wolfeboro</m_str> (1_35) 	<m_str>Wolfeboro</m_str> (2_7) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
