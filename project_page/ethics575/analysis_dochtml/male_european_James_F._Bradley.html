<blue>1</blue>James F. Bradley Jr. , whose late-night brainstorm as a Navy officer led to the development of a system for tapping into Soviet submarine communications , died on March 3 at a nursing home in McLean , Va . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 81 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was complications from a heart attack , family members said . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Bradley , who retired from the Navy in 1974 as a captain , was credited with discovering a way in the 1970 's to find underwater Soviet naval cables that were used for communications . <br><blue>5</blue>The first tap , in the Pacific , was used for nearly a decade before it was betrayed by a spy in 1981 , but the method was successfully used in other locales until the end of the cold war . <br><blue>6</blue>Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew , the authors of '' Blind Man 's Bluff '' ( Public Affairs , 1998 ) , wrote that Captain Bradley thought up the system in his office at 3 a.m . <br><blue>7</blue>He was assigned to a military intelligence unit at the time . <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Bradley recalled that in his childhood , the banks of the Mississippi River were dotted with signs warning , '' Cable Crossing -- Do Not Anchor . '' <br><blue>9</blue>He reasoned that if the Soviets had similar signs along their coasts , the United States Navy could find the lines and then tap into them . <br><blue>10</blue>In 1971 , the American submarine Halibut slowly approached the Siberian coast with its periscope up . <br><blue>11</blue>The sailors and intelligence officers aboard found cable signs , and then American divers put a tap at the bottom of the Sea of Okhotsk to intercept Soviet communications , including those from the Northern Fleet and the K.G.B. , the Soviet spy agency . <br><blue>12</blue>American intelligence was able to intercept these communications until 1980 , when a National Security Agency employee , Ronald W. Pelton , told the Soviets that the United States had tapped into the cable communications . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Pelton was convicted of espionage in 1986 and sentenced to life in prison . <br><blue>14</blue>James Francis Bradley Jr. was born on Sept. 5 , 1920 , in St. Louis . <br><blue>15</blue>He joined the Navy and in World War II commanded an amphibious landing ship at the battles of Leyte Gulf and Okinawa . <br><blue>16</blue>He graduated in 1945 from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis . <br><blue>17</blue>He later served as the commanding officer of a transport ship in the Vietnam War and as a submarine division commander , a naval attach√© in Germany and an intelligence officer . <br><blue>18</blue>In 1966 , he became the undersea warfare director in the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington . <br><blue>19</blue>In that job , around 1970 , he came up with the plan to intercept Soviet communications . <br><blue>20</blue>In 1974 , after leaving the Navy , he took a job in Baltimore with the Westinghouse Corporation . <br><hr><br><blue>1(5)</blue>: <m_str>the United States Navy</m_str> (9_14) 	<m_str>the United States</m_str> (12_27) 	<m_str>the Navy</m_str> (15_3) 	<m_str>the United States Naval Academy</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>the Navy</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>2(7)</blue>: <m_str>James Francis Bradley Jr.</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the American submarine Halibut</m_str> (10_4) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (10_14) 	<br><blue>4(6)</blue>: <m_str>Captain Bradley</m_str> (6_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_32) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Bradley</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_1) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (9_26) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>the Soviets</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>the Soviets</m_str> (12_24) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>1986</m_str> (13_8) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>The first tap , in the Pacific</m_str> (5_1) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>Soviet communications</m_str> (11_28) 	<m_str>these communications</m_str> (12_7) 	<m_str>the cable communications</m_str> (12_33) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
