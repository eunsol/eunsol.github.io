<blue>1</blue>Paul Steiner , who helped reshape the publishing business in the United States and made the illustrated coffee table book an industry staple , died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 83 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Steiner , the founder of the Chanticleer Press , followed a circuitous path into publishing . <br><blue>4</blue>A native of Vienna , he studied law and worked as a secretary to an Austrian newspaper publisher before fleeing the Nazis in 1939 and coming to the United States . <br><blue>5</blue>He sold vacuum cleaners and worked as a roofer in Akron , Ohio , before a friend from Vienna who had opened a publishing venture in London asked him to start a subsidiary in the United States . <br><blue>6</blue>The result was the Chanticleer Press , which became independent in 1952 and is regarded as the first of the nation 's publishing packagers -- companies that generally operate behind the scenes , dreaming up ideas and commissioning and assembling text and photographs for books that are then distributed under contract by established publishers . <br><blue>7</blue>If old-line publishers sometimes look askance at packagers , reluctant to admit that they need outside help in creating some of the books they ultimately distribute under their own imprimaturs , Mr. Steiner 's success made a compelling case for such arrangements , particularly for lavishly illustrated , oversized books that are especially expensive to produce . <br><blue>8</blue>Although Mr. Steiner began specializing in photographic books in the 1950 's , his greatest recent success came in the 1970 's when he began putting together the " National Audubon Society 's Field Guide " and " Pocket Guide " series . <br><blue>9</blue>The books , which are published by Knopf , are believed to be the first such guides to use photographs rather than drawings of birds . <br><blue>10</blue>And , in a reflection of Mr. Steiner 's acute sense of color and design , they also broke with tradition by grouping birds by size , shape and color rather than by type . <br><blue>11</blue>It proved a winning formula . <br><blue>12</blue>More than 10 million of the Audubon guides have been sold . <br><blue>13</blue>Under Mr. Steiner , Chanticleer also published other nature series , including the " Collins Bird Guides of Britain and Europe , " " Wildlife Habitat " and " Taylor 's Guides to Gardening , " as well as many single-volume works , among them , Mary McCarthy 's " Stones of Florence , " Edward Steichen 's " Life in Photography " and Peter Matthiessen 's " African Experience . " <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Steiner is survived by his wife , Marianne ; a son , Thomas , of Chappaqua , N.Y. , and three grandchildren . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (5_35) 	<m_str>the United States</m_str> (1_11) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Chanticleer Press</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>the Chanticleer Press , which became independent in 1952 and is regarded as the first of the nation 's publishing packagers</m_str> (6_4) 	<br><blue>3(8)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (8_24) 	<m_str>Mr. Steiner</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Steiner</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Steiner 's</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Steiner 's</m_str> (7_32) 	<m_str>Mr. Steiner</m_str> (8_2) 	<br><blue>4(4)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>old-line publishers</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (7_24) 	<br><blue>5(5)</blue>: <m_str>him</m_str> (5_29) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_29) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
