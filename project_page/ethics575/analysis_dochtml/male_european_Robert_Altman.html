<blue>1</blue>Robert Altman , one of the most adventurous and influential American directors of the late 20th century , a filmmaker whose iconoclastic career spanned more than five decades but whose stamp was felt most forcefully in one , the 1970s , died Monday in Los Angeles . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 81 . <br><blue>3</blue>His death , at Cedars Sinai Medical Center , was caused by complications of cancer , his company in New York , Sandcastle 5 Productions , announced . <br><blue>4</blue>A spokesman said Mr. Altman had learned that he had cancer 18 months ago but continued to work , shooting his final film , '' A Prairie Home Companion , '' which was released in June , and most recently completing pre-production on a new film that he intended to begin shooting in February . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Altman had a heart transplant in the mid-1990s , a fact he publicly revealed for the first time last March while accepting an honorary Oscar at the Academy Awards ceremony . <br><blue>6</blue>A risk taker with a tendency toward mischief , Mr. Altman put together something of a late-career comeback capped in 2001 by '' Gosford Park , '' a multiple Oscar nominee . <br><blue>7</blue>But he may be best remembered for a run of masterly films -- six in five years -- that propelled him to the forefront of American directors and culminated in 1975 with what many regard as his greatest film , '' Nashville , '' a complex , character-filled drama told against the backdrop of a presidential primary . <br><blue>8</blue>They were free-wheeling , genre-bending films that captured the jaded disillusionment of the '70s . <br><blue>9</blue>The best known was '' MASH , '' the 1970 comedy that was set in a field hospital during the Korean war but that was clearly aimed at antiwar sentiments engendered by Vietnam . <br><blue>10</blue>Its success , both critically and at the box office , opened the way for Mr. Altman to pursue his ambitions . <br><blue>11</blue>In 1971 he took on the western , making '' McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller '' with Warren Beatty and Julie Christie . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1972 , he dramatized a woman 's psychological disintegration in '' Images , '' starring Susannah York . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1973 , he tackled the private-eye genre with a somewhat loopy adaptation of Raymond Chandler 's '' The Long Goodbye , '' with the laid-back Elliott Gould playing Philip Marlowe as a '70s retro-hipster . <br><blue>14</blue>And in 1974 he released two films , exploring gambling addiction in '' California Split '' and riffing on the Dust Bowl gangster saga with '' Thieves Like Us . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Unlike most directors whose flames burned brightest in the early 1970s -- and frequently flickered out -- Mr. Altman did not come to Hollywood from critical journals and newfangled film schools . <br><blue>16</blue>He had had a long career in industrial films and television . <br><blue>17</blue>In an era that celebrated fresh voices steeped in film history -- young directors like Francis Ford Coppola , Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese -- Mr. Altman was like their bohemian uncle , matching the young rebels in their skeptical disdain for the staid conventions of mainstream filmmaking and the establishment that supported it . <br><blue>18</blue>Most of his actors adored him and praised his improvisational style . <br><blue>19</blue>In his prime , he was celebrated for his ground-breaking use of multilayer soundtracks . <br><blue>20</blue>An Altman film might offer a babble of voices competing for attention in crowded , smoky scenes . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>mainstream filmmaking</m_str> (17_47) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (17_54) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>Francis Ford Coppola , Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese</m_str> (17_16) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (17_39) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (17_30) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>his final film</m_str> (4_21) 	<m_str>his greatest film</m_str> (7_37) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Vietnam</m_str> (9_33) 	<m_str>Its</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>An Altman film</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>McCabe</m_str> (11_11) 	<br><blue>7(29)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Altman</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_48) 	<m_str>Mr. Altman</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>Mr. Altman put together something of a late-career comeback</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (7_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_37) 	<m_str>Mr. Altman</m_str> (10_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Altman</m_str> (15_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Altman</m_str> (17_26) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (18_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>Altman</m_str> (20_2) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
