<blue>1</blue>Chen Yun , a conservative Communist Party patriarch whose revulsion to Western capitalism was an important brake on the pace of economic reform in China during the last 16 years , died yesterday afternoon , a spokesman for the State Council , or cabinet , announced early today . <br><blue>2</blue>The cause of death was not disclosed , but the spokesman said China 's official media would report details later today . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Chen was 89 . <br><blue>4</blue>Due to his seniority and influence in the party , Mr. Chen and the conservative central planners and Marxist ideologues whom he led were the principal counterweight to the economic opening by Deng Xiaoping that is transforming China . <br><blue>5</blue>Although Mr. Deng established himself as paramount leader in 1978 , he was only first among equals with the revolutionary elders who founded the People 's Republic of China in 1949 and who survived Mao Zedong , who died in 1976 . <br><blue>6</blue>Thus Mr. Chen was once a formidable political obstacle with whom Mr. Deng was forced to compromise over policy and the structure of the next generation of leaders . <br><blue>7</blue>Those leaders remain divided over how to carry out China 's long-delayed modernization . <br><blue>8</blue>After a bout with an upper respiratory ailment last spring , Mr. Chen was thought to be near death . <br><blue>9</blue>In June a number of top leaders rushed to his bedside in Shanghai , as did his family members , at least one of whom was in the United States . <br><blue>10</blue>But Mr. Chen recovered . <br><blue>11</blue>Seeing so many people gathered in his room , he is said to have rebuked them , saying , " I 'm not going to die yet . " <br><blue>12</blue>Several weeks ago Mr. Chen was admitted to an exclusive ward of Beijing Hospital reserved for party leaders , and reportedly received frequent dialysis for kidney failure . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Chen was last seen in public in February 1994 , in a televised greeting from party leaders during the Lunar New Year celebration . <br><blue>14</blue>He looked remarkably fit at the time , much more so than Mr. Deng , who also made his last television appearance at that time . <br><blue>15</blue>As politically powerful as he was , Mr. Chen was self-effacing , going to extremes to stay out of the limelight , and preferring to work quietly behind the scenes . <br><blue>16</blue>In the summer of 1989 , for example , his nurse complimented him on a television series that was portraying him very favorably . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Chen , who was unaware of the series , then asked the Communist Party leader , Jiang Zemin , to stop the series because he did not want his contributions to be singled out , according to a Chinese with direct knowledge of the incident . <br><blue>18</blue>Likewise , Mr. Chen resisted for many years proposals that he move to Zhongnanhai , the leaders ' compound in the center of Beijing . <br><blue>19</blue>He said that his home , in an alley just outside the compound , made it easier for him to mix with friends and ordinary Chinese . <br><blue>20</blue>About a decade ago , Mr. Chen gave in and moved with his family to a villa in Zhongnanhai . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>: <m_str>Deng Xiaoping that is transforming China</m_str> (4_33) 	<m_str>Mr. Deng</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Deng</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Deng , who also made his last television appearance at that time</m_str> (14_13) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>leaders</m_str> (6_28) 	<m_str>the leaders '</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>Those leaders</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>the next generation of leaders</m_str> (6_24) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>Communist Party</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>Communist Party</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>the party</m_str> (4_8) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (19_16) 	<m_str>his home , in an alley just outside the compound</m_str> (19_4) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>his family</m_str> (20_13) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>a television series that was portraying him very favorably</m_str> (16_15) 	<m_str>the series</m_str> (17_23) 	<m_str>the series</m_str> (17_8) 	<br><blue>8(5)</blue>: <m_str>China 's</m_str> (7_10) 	<m_str>China</m_str> (1_25) 	<m_str>China</m_str> (4_38) 	<m_str>China 's</m_str> (2_13) 	<m_str>the People 's Republic of China</m_str> (5_24) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>Shanghai</m_str> (9_13) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>the People 's</m_str> (5_24) 	<br><blue>11(33)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (14_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_10) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen , who was unaware of the series</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_30) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen</m_str> (4_11) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (11_21) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen was admitted to an exclusive ward of Beijing Hospital</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (19_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_22) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen</m_str> (20_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_13) 	<m_str>Mr. Chen</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
