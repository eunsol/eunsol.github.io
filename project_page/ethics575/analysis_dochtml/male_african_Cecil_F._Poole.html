<blue>1</blue>Cecil F. Poole , the first black United States Attorney outside a United States territory and the first black Federal judge in Northern California , has died in Kentfield , Calif . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 83 . <br><blue>3</blue>Judge Poole died on Wednesday of complications from pneumonia , said the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , in San Francisco , on which he served from 1979 to 1996 . <br><blue>4</blue>He had continued to serve on the court part time . <br><blue>5</blue>Judge Poole 's career included a number of landmark appointments , the first of which was in 1961 when President John F. Kennedy named him United States Attorney for San Francisco . <br><blue>6</blue>Until then , all other black United States Attorneys had served in the United States Virgin Islands . <br><blue>7</blue>In the 1960 's , Mr. Poole 's office increasingly had to deal with issues involving the movement against the Vietnam War and the blacks ' fight for civil rights . <br><blue>8</blue>To intense criticism , he refused to prosecute hundreds of draft evaders , helped to dismiss charges against five draft protesters who were accused of sedition , and denounced a plan to prosecute David Hilliard , a leader of the Black Panthers , for an implied threat to kill President Richard M. Nixon . <br><blue>9</blue>In the late 1960 's , President Lyndon B. Johnson twice nominated Mr. Poole to the bench of the Federal District Court for Northern California . <br><blue>10</blue>But those appointments were held up by Senator George Murphy , Republican of California , who accused Mr. Poole of being too liberal . <br><blue>11</blue>Mr. Poole left the United States Attorney 's office in 1970 and entered private practice , working mainly in entertainment law . <br><blue>12</blue>He represented the rock musicians Jefferson Airplane , Janis Joplin and the Doobie Brothers , one of whose platinum albums he later hung on the wall in his judge 's chamber next to photographs of him with Presidents Kennedy and Johnson . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1976 , Mr. Poole was again nominated to the bench of Federal District Court , this time by President Gerald R. Ford . <br><blue>14</blue>His appointment was confirmed , making him the first black Federal judge in Northern California . <br><blue>15</blue>President Jimmy Carter elevated Judge Poole to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1979 , making him the first black to serve on the court and the second black in the country on any Federal Circuit Court of Appeals . <br><blue>16</blue>He was considered an influential member of the appeals court , ruling , for example , in favor of Native American groups in Alaska seeking sovereignty over their lands and against the city of Oakland for not doing enough to protect an employee against sexual harassment . '' <br><blue>17</blue>His personal sympathies were for civil rights and for individuals who were faced with being prosecuted by the law , '' said Proctor Hug , chief judge of the Ninth Circuit . <br><blue>18</blue>Judge Poole was known for encouraging young black lawyers and hiring minority law clerks . <br><blue>19</blue>In a few cases , he was the object of racial discrimination , once when a cross was set afire on his lawn in San Francisco and when he was denied an apartment when a landlord saw that he was black , said a onetime colleague in private practice , William Coblentz . <br><blue>20</blue>From 1949 to 1961 , Mr. Poole worked in the San Francisco District Attorney 's office under Edmund G. Brown , who later became the state 's Governor . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>: <m_str>San Francisco</m_str> (20_11) 	<m_str>San Francisco</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>San Francisco</m_str> (3_24) 	<m_str>San Francisco</m_str> (19_25) 	<br><blue>2(5)</blue>: <m_str>United States</m_str> (5_26) 	<m_str>United States</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>the United States</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>United States</m_str> (1_8) 	<m_str>United States</m_str> (1_13) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>President Lyndon B.
