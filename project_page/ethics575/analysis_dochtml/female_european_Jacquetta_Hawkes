<blue>1</blue>Jacquetta Hawkes , archeologist and author , who was the widow of the playwright and novelist J. B. Priestley , died on Monday at Cheltenham General Hospital in London . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 85 , and lived in the Cotswolds town of Chipping Camden . <br><blue>3</blue>In " Man on Earth , " " A Land " and many other books , Ms. Hawkes searched for the humanity within science . <br><blue>4</blue>She said , " Let us have the courage to accept the inner experience that tells us we are something more and that we may be part of a process much greater still . " <br><blue>5</blue>Her fervent interest was in the world of prehistory . <br><blue>6</blue>Discovering a Neanderthal skeleton , she said : " I was conscious of this vanished being and myself as part of an unbroken stream of consciousness . . . With an imaginative effort it is possible to see the eternal present in which all days , all the seasons of the plain , stand in enduring unity . " <br><blue>7</blue>In her polymathic career , she was also a poet and novelist and , in collaboration with her husband , a playwright . <br><blue>8</blue>Reviewing " Time and the Priestleys , the Story of a Friendship , " Diana Collins 's 1994 double biography of Mr. Priestley and Ms. Hawkes , Peter Ackroyd said there was no reason Ms. Hawkes " should be remembered as the wife of anyone . . . since her own story is as interesting and as compelling as that of Priestley himself . " <br><blue>9</blue>That story began in her childhood when she dug in her family garden , which had once been part of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery . <br><blue>10</blue>As Mr. Ackroyd said , " She discovered nothing , but found within herself a lasting treasure ; it was her love of learning and her passion for the past . " <br><blue>11</blue>It was her goal in life " to retrieve the landscapes of history . " <br><blue>12</blue>Jacquetta Hopkins was born on Aug. 10 , 1910 , in Cambridge , which became the center of her early life . <br><blue>13</blue>She graduated from the university with a degree in archeology and anthropology . <br><blue>14</blue>In 1933 , she married Christopher Hawkes , a professor of archeology , and they had a son , Nicolas . <br><blue>15</blue>Her interest in archeology took her on expeditions to Palestine as well as England . <br><blue>16</blue>During and immediately after World War II , she held several government posts and was the founder of the United Kingdom Commission for Unesco . <br><blue>17</blue>Her 1951 book , " A Land " ( with illustrations by Henry Moore ) , was based on her work as archeological adviser for the Festival of Britain . <br><blue>18</blue>In his review in the New York Times Book Review , Stanley Edgar Hyman said that Ms. Hawkes had told the " story of the shaping of the earth and the development of life with simple eloquence " and described " A Land " as " a triumph of skill as well as a work of love . " <br><blue>19</blue>Through the next 30 years Ms. Hawkes was a prolific author , writing bold and often poetic books about archeology , geology and the history of mankind . <br><blue>20</blue>In 1947 she met Mr. Priestley at a Unesco conference in Mexico City . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>archeology</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>archeology</m_str> (19_20) 	<m_str>archeology</m_str> (14_12) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>his review in the New York Times Book Review</m_str> (18_2) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>her own story</m_str> (8_48) 	<m_str>That story</m_str> (9_1) 	<br><blue>4(34)</blue>: <m_str>Her</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_26) 	<m_str>Ms. Hawkes</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>Ms. Hawkes</m_str> (3_17) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_18) 	<m_str>Ms. Hawkes</m_str> (19_6) 	<m_str>Jacquetta Hopkins</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_3) 	<m_str>Diana Collins 's</m_str> (8_15) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>Ms. Hawkes</m_str> (8_25) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>Ms. Hawkes</m_str> (8_35) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_20) 	<m_str>myself</m_str> (6_18) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_48) 	<m_str>herself</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_21) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Stanley Edgar Hyman</m_str> (18_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_2) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Peter Ackroyd</m_str> (8_28) 	<m_str>Mr. Ackroyd</m_str> (10_2) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>a son , Nicolas</m_str> (14_17) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Priestley</m_str> (8_60) 	<m_str>Mr. Priestley</m_str> (20_5) 	<br><blue>9(4)</blue>: <m_str>us</m_str> (4_17) 	<m_str>we</m_str> (4_18) 	<m_str>us</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>we</m_str> (4_24) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>a lasting treasure</m_str> (10_15) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (10_19) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
