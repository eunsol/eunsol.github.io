<blue>1</blue>Floyd B. McKissick , an early leader of the civil rights movement who was named a state district judge in North Carolina last June , died Sunday at his home in Durham , N.C . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 69 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>He died of lung cancer , said his son , Floyd Jr. , his partner in the law firm of McKissick &amp; McKissick in Durham . <br><blue>4</blue>A maverick among civil rights leaders , Mr. McKissick served as director of the Congress of Racial Equality in 1966 and 1967 , became a prominent backer of President Richard M. Nixon 's successful re-election effort in 1972 and spent several years in the late 1970 's in a vain attempt to build a North Carolina town , Soul City , run by blacks . <br><blue>5</blue>For most of his career , Mr. McKissick was a lawyer with a practice in criminal defense and personal injury cases . <br><blue>6</blue>He dated his devotion to the cause of equal rights for blacks to a day in 1935 when , as a 13-year-old Boy Scout helping to direct traffic during a roller-skating tournament in his native Asheville , N.C. , he was knocked to the ground by a white police officer . <br><blue>7</blue>The son of the head bellman at the Vanderbilt Hotel in Asheville , he carted ice on a homemade wagon , delivered newspapers and shined shoes to help support his family . <br><blue>8</blue>He was drafted into the Army in World War II and served as a sergeant in Europe . <br><blue>9</blue>After the war he studied at Morehouse College , received a bachelor 's degree from North Carolina College and in 1951 applied for admission to the all-white University of North Carolina Law School at Chapel Hill . <br><blue>10</blue>Champion of Civil Rights He was barred . <br><blue>11</blue>But Thurgood Marshall , then a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and later a Unitd Supreme Court Justice , took his case and won an order from a Federal appeals court to admit Mr. McKissick to the law school . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. McKissick became the N.A.A.C.P. 's North Carolina youth chairman and began working with CORE , an interracial offshoot of the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation that was founded in 1942 , dedicated to applying the nonviolence principles of Mohandas K. Gandhi to the struggle for civil rights . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1947 Mr. McKissick joined James Farmer , a founder of CORE , in an integrated bus ride through the South . <br><blue>14</blue>They often encountered hostility , which Mr. McKissick called " my baptism in nonviolence . " <br><blue>15</blue>As a lawyer Mr. McKissick took on a number of desegregation cases , defending demonstrators who sat in white sections of lunch counters and theaters in Durham and successfully filing suits to enable each of his children to enter all-white schools . <br><blue>16</blue>A Change in CORE 's Ideology In January 1966 Mr. McKissick , who had been the unpaid national chairman of CORE , succeeded Mr. Farmer as its director . <br><blue>17</blue>Moving away from the biracial identity of CORE , and at the same time refusing to support the call of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for nonviolent civil disobedience , Mr. McKissick sought to shift CORE 's focus to bringing political and economic power to blacks . <br><blue>18</blue>In September 1967 , after 18 months at the helm at CORE , he took a leave to work on a Ford Foundation project to help blacks attain positions of responsibility in cities in which they were moving toward a majority in population . <br><blue>19</blue>Before the 1972 Presidential election , Mr. McKissick angered many blacks by switching from the Democratic Party to the Republicans and supporting Mr. Nixon 's re-election campaign . <br><blue>20</blue>He argued that blacks were ill-advised to put all their hopes in the Democratic Party . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Asheville</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>Asheville</m_str> (6_36) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>blacks</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (20_10) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Democratic Party</m_str> (20_13) 	<m_str>the Democratic Party</m_str> (19_15) 	<br><blue>4(13)</blue>: <m_str>President Richard M.
