Eugene S.

" <br><blue>10</blue>Successful Transition Dwindling grants forced Harlem Prep to yield its independence in 1974 , when it was taken over by the New York City school system . <br><blue>11</blue>Although Mr. Carpenter was skeptical that the school would continue true to its mission , he stayed on as its director and eventually called the transition a success . <br><blue>12</blue>He went on to other positions , including assistant principal of the Charles E. Hughes and Norman Thomas High Schools and spent a year teaching education at the City College of New York . <br><blue>13</blue>He retired in 1986 . <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Carpenter , who was born in Manhattan , earned a bachelor 's degree from Long Island University , a master 's from Columbia and a doctorate from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst . <br><blue>15</blue>Serving as a second lieutenant in the Army in the Pacific during World War II , he won several medals , including a Purple Heart . <br><blue>16</blue>Community Services Prior to Harlem Prep , he worked as a guidance counselor in the city schools and was director of community services for the Children and Parents Center at Queens College , a program for preschoolers from impoverished neighborhoods . <br><blue>17</blue>In Teaneck , he served on the ethics advisory board for the town government and was chairman of the local spiritual assembly of the Bahai faith . <br><blue>18</blue>Surviving are his wife , the former Lela McCants ; a son , Edward F.
