<blue>1</blue>Shankar Dayal Sharma , the emotional but decisive president of India in the turbulent years from 1992 to 1997 , died on Dec. 26 in a hospital in New Delhi . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 81 and lived in New Delhi . <br><blue>3</blue>A longtime member of the Congress Party , he was its president for a time . <br><blue>4</blue>Dr. Sharma , whose doctorate was in law from Cambridge , was elected , with support from Congress and leftist groups , ninth president of India . <br><blue>5</blue>That role is is largely ceremonial , though its powers include discretion in choosing a prime minister if no party has a parliamentary majority . <br><blue>6</blue>In 1996 , when that situation arose , Dr. Sharma was at the center of a maelstrom over forming government . <br><blue>7</blue>He was faced with what constitutional experts said then was one of the most challenging moments in the history of independent India . <br><blue>8</blue>He went on to win praise for giving the prime ministership to Atal Bihari Vajpayee , president of the main Hindu nationalist party , who had not been prime minister but who portrayed himself as a conciliator . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Vajpayee failed to win a vote of confidence and stepped down after 13 days in office . <br><blue>10</blue>But he rebounded and is the current prime minister . <br><blue>11</blue>In 1996 , Dr. Sharma voiced a hopeful view of the future of Indian-Chinese relations . <br><blue>12</blue>In a speech at a banquet attended by President Jiang Zemin of China , he spoke of the countries as '' the two great nations of broad-mindedness and wisdom '' that had pioneered human civilization , adding , '' We will surely bring a cooperative and constructive partnership into the 21st century . '' <br><blue>13</blue>In his first year as president , Dr. Sharma took control of Uttar Pradesh in northeastern India and dismissed the state legislature . <br><blue>14</blue>He acted after Hindu militants from around India had gone to the state and destroyed a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya , which they said had been built on the site where the Hindu god Ram was born . <br><blue>15</blue>More than 1,000 people , most of them Muslims , died in the ensuing nationwide violence between Hindus and Muslims . <br><blue>16</blue>Dr. Sharma was sometimes highly emotional . <br><blue>17</blue>In 1990 , while he was vice president and was presiding over the upper house of Parliament at time of turmoil , he broke into tears and left the hall , saying that he could not be a party to '' the murder of democracy . '' <br><blue>18</blue>He was born in the state of Bhopal in central India . <br><blue>19</blue>After receiving master 's degrees from Lucknow University , he he joined the movement for independence from British rule and was imprisoned for a time before India became independent in 1947 . <br><blue>20</blue>From 1974 to 1977 , Dr. Sharma was communications minister , and later he became governor of Andra Pradesh and Punjab . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>1996</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>1996</m_str> (11_2) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>the Congress Party</m_str> (3_5) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>Congress</m_str> (4_18) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (5_9) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>India</m_str> (1_11) 	<m_str>India</m_str> (4_26) 	<m_str>India</m_str> (19_27) 	<br><blue>4(21)</blue>: <m_str>Dr. Sharma</m_str> (6_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (8_34) 	<m_str>Mr. Vajpayee</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>Dr. Sharma</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_15) 	<m_str>Dr. Sharma</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>the Hindu god Ram</m_str> (14_32) 	<m_str>Dr. Sharma</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_34) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_23) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_14) 	<m_str>Dr. Sharma</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>New Delhi</m_str> (1_29) 	<m_str>New Delhi</m_str> (2_7) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Muslims</m_str> (15_20) 	<m_str>Muslims</m_str> (15_9) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>Shankar Dayal Sharma , the emotional but decisive president of India in the turbulent years from 1992 to 1997</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_9) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Hindu</m_str> (8_21) 	<m_str>Hindu</m_str> (14_4) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>Hindu militants</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (14_23) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (15_8) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
