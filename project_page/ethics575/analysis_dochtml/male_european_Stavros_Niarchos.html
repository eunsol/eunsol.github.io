<blue>1</blue>Stavros S. Niarchos , the shadowy Greek shipping magnate who spent much of his life battling his archrival Aristotle Onassis for supremacy on the high seas , in conspicuous consumption and at the altar , died on Monday at a hospital in Zurich . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 86 . <br><blue>3</blue>Officials of Niarchos Ltd. , the shipping company he built into an international behemoth that once operated more than 80 tankers , disclosed his death through its London office yesterday but gave no details . <br><blue>4</blue>He was reported several weeks ago to have had a stroke . <br><blue>5</blue>Although he was known as a mystery man , there was little mystery in the way Stavros Spyros Niarchos built a personal fortune estimated at $ 4 billion . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Niarchos , whose name means " master of ships , " was quite simply a master at seizing the moment and turning it to his advantage , especially if it involved the complex world of shipping . <br><blue>7</blue>What others perceived as disaster , he recognized as opportunity , whether it be economic depression , war or a shortage -- or glut -- of oil . <br><blue>8</blue>The secret of his shipping success was deceptively simple : buy cheap and buy big . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Niarchos , who was conceived in Buffalo , N.Y. , where his Greek-born parents had become naturalized American citizens , was born in Athens on July 3 , 1909 , three months after his parents had returned from the United States . <br><blue>10</blue>Growing up in the adjacent port city of Piraeus , he developed a lifelong love of the water , swimming frequently and sailing his first boat at the age of 9 . <br><blue>11</blue>Although he earned a law degree from the University of Athens at age 20 , his father 's financial reversals forced him to seek a more immediately promising career ; he joined a flour-milling operation operated by his maternal uncles . <br><blue>12</blue>The business imported grain from Argentina , and seeking to keep costs down in the 1930 's , Mr. Niarchos recognized that the family could save freight fees by operating its own ships . <br><blue>13</blue>At his urging , his uncles bought seven battered freighters at the Depression-level prices of $ 20,000 each , and the Niarchos fleet was born . <br><blue>14</blue>He soon added to the holdings , always buying the largest ships available . <br><blue>15</blue>World War II proved a bonanza for him . <br><blue>16</blue>He leased his ships to the Allies in 1941 and spent the rest of the war in the Greek Navy . <br><blue>17</blue>When the war ended in 1945 , Mr. Niarchos , who had become the assistant Greek naval attache in Washington , did not grieve over the loss of six of his ships to German bombs and submarine attacks , but took his $ 2 million in insurance proceeds and began buying up surplus Liberty and Victory cargo ships and T2 tankers that had been mass produced during the war . <br><blue>18</blue>To get around American restrictions on the sale of such ships to foreigners , Mr. Niarchos formed a company in which his American-born sister and some American friends owned a three-quarter interest . <br><blue>19</blue>But after Mr. Niarchos compounded his audacity by leasing the ships to a Panamanian company to avoid American taxes , the Government sued and he agreed to pay a $ 12 million fine , give up some of the ships and have three supertankers built at American shipyards . <br><blue>20</blue>As usual , the settlement ended up to his advantage . <br><hr><br><blue>1(6)</blue>: <m_str>its own ships</m_str> (12_31) 	<m_str>the largest ships</m_str> (14_10) 	<m_str>his ships</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>his ships</m_str> (17_31) 	<m_str>the ships</m_str> (19_39) 	<m_str>the ships</m_str> (19_10) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>his Greek-born parents</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>his parents</m_str> (9_35) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>The business</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the family</m_str> (12_23) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (12_31) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>the war in the Greek Navy</m_str> (16_15) 	<m_str>the war</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>the war</m_str> (17_68) 	<br><blue>6(40)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_17) 	<m_str>his archrival Aristotle Onassis</m_str> (1_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_24) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>Stavros Spyros Niarchos</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_26) 	<m_str>Mr. Niarchos , whose name means `` master of ships , ''</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_35) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>his father 's</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (11_22) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_31) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_38) 	<m_str>Mr. Niarchos</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>Niarchos</m_str> (13_22) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>Mr. Niarchos , who had become the assistant Greek naval attache in Washington</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_31) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_42) 	<m_str>Mr. Niarchos</m_str> (18_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_22) 	<m_str>Mr. Niarchos</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>his maternal uncles</m_str> (11_38) 	<m_str>his uncles</m_str> (13_5) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>the settlement</m_str> (20_4) 	<br><blue>9(4)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (6_31) 	<m_str>the moment</m_str> (6_20) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (6_24) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (7_13) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
