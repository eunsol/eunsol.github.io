<blue>1</blue>Yves Montand , the French actor and singer whose political views and passionate affairs stirred as much controversy as his film roles and songs won him popularity , died near Paris today . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 70 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>He apparently suffered a heart attack while working on his latest film on location in Senlis and died at the local hospital . <br><blue>4</blue>His death came as a shock to the French public , which over four decades had grown accustomed to following his life , his loves and his opinions on everything from regional cooking to third world immigration . <br><blue>5</blue>As an artist , he will be remembered for songs like " Autumn Leaves " and " The Urchins of Paris " and for his roles in Henri-Georges Clouzot 's " Wages of Fear , " Costa-Gavras 's " Z " and " The Confession , " and Claude Berri 's " Jean de Florette " and " Manon of the Spring . " <br><blue>6</blue>His Best-Known Liaisons But his name also will always be widely associated with three women -- the singer Edith Piaf , who turned him into a music hall star , the actress Simone Signoret , to whom he was married for 36 years until her death in 1985 , and Marilyn Monroe , with whom he had a much-publicized affair in 1960 . <br><blue>7</blue>Such was his following in France that in 1988 he was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate . <br><blue>8</blue>By then , the man who for 25 years had been a darling of the French left had swung dramatically to the right , as ready to denounce Communism as to praise Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher . <br><blue>9</blue>His popularity survived his travels through passion and politics because his ability to charm the French -- and a good many foreigners -- never faltered . <br><blue>10</blue>In recent years , his hair thinning and his face wrinkled , he exuded the air of a favorite uncle who would always be around . <br><blue>11</blue>While he came to personify the quintessential French romantic , half-adventurer , half-intellectual , he was in fact born an Italian -- Ivo Livi by name -- at Monsummano Alto , Tuscany , on Oct. 13 , 1921 , just two years before the rise of Fascism prompted his father to migrate to France . <br><blue>12</blue>Working-Class Roots Brought up in a working-class family in Marseilles , he left school at the age of 11 and worked in factories , bars and a hair salon while dreaming of a career in entertainment . <br><blue>13</blue>He performed for the first time on an amateur night in a local theater when he was just 17 . <br><blue>14</blue>By the time he was in his early twenties , he had taken the name Yves Montand and was singing in Paris . <br><blue>15</blue>But the turning point came when he was spotted by Edith Piaf . <br><blue>16</blue>They fell in love and lived together for two years . <br><blue>17</blue>In the meantime , she not only put his name up in lights but launched his movie career in 1946 . <br><blue>18</blue>They made several films together , but when Clouzot cast him in " Wages of Fear " in 1953 , he became a star in his own right . <br><blue>19</blue>Soon afterward , he met and married Miss Signoret . <br><blue>20</blue>As a singer he continued to flourish , thanks to his skill in combining his smooth baritone voice with appealingly poetic lyrics and light-footed dance routines . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Jean de Florette</m_str> (5_53) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Jean de Florette '' and `` Manon</m_str> (5_53) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (6_45) 	<m_str>Simone Signoret</m_str> (6_33) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Spring</m_str> (5_61) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Miss Signoret</m_str> (19_8) 	<br><blue>6(46)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (7_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_38) 	<m_str>the man who for 25 years had been a darling of the French left</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_56) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_9) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (1_26) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_13) 	<m_str>Clouzot</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_24) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_27) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_15) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_25) 	<m_str>Henri-Georges Clouzot 's</m_str> (5_28) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>Costa-Gavras 's</m_str> (5_37) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_3) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (6_24) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>his name</m_str> (17_9) 	<m_str>his name</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>the name</m_str> (14_14) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>Paris</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (14_22) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (5_21) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>his latest film on location</m_str> (3_10) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
