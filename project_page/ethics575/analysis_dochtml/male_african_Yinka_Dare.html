<blue>1</blue>Yinka Dare , a 7-foot , 265-pound center who was the Nets ' surprise first-round choice in the 1994 N.B.A. draft , then became a symbol of the franchise 's misfortunes , died Friday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 32 . <br><blue>3</blue>Dare had a heart attack at his home , said his brother , Michael , who lived with him in Englewood . <br><blue>4</blue>Dare ( pronounced dar-RAY ) , a native of Nigeria , was chosen by the Nets with the 14th pick over all after his sophomore season at George Washington University , which he led into the N.C.A.A. tournament in both his seasons . <br><blue>5</blue>Dare had averaged in double digits as a scorer and rebounder and was envisioned by the Nets as an eventual shot-blocking force . <br><blue>6</blue>But the Nets had never given him a workout and acknowledged that he was a long-term project . <br><blue>7</blue>Willis Reed , the former star center of the Knicks who was the Nets ' general manager at the time , and Paul Silas , a Nets assistant coach who had been a fine N.B.A. player , were on hand to tutor Dare . '' <br><blue>8</blue>He is quick off his feet , a little bit like Hakeem Olajuwon , '' Nets Coach Butch Beard said in July 1994 , comparing Dare to the Houston Rockets ' star center , also a native of Nigeria . <br><blue>9</blue>But Dare , signed to a multiyear , multimillion-dollar contract , made virtually no contribution to the Nets . <br><blue>10</blue>He played in only one game in his rookie season before undergoing arthroscopic surgery to remove loose cartilage behind his kneecaps . <br><blue>11</blue>He appeared in only 110 games , averaging 2.1 points , before being traded in February 1998 to the Orlando Magic , who quickly released him . <br><blue>12</blue>Dare 's failure to make it in the N.B.A. was among the numerous problems faced by the Nets over a long stretch . <br><blue>13</blue>In the three full seasons that Dare was with the Nets , they did not make the playoffs , and in the next four seasons , they did not win a playoff game . <br><blue>14</blue>In addition to his brother , Michael , Dare is survived by his parents , Gabriel and Joan Dare , and two sisters , Tobi and Christina Dare , of Nigeria . '' <br><blue>15</blue>I always thought he was going to be the next Hakeem Olajuwon , '' the Nets ' star guard , Jason Kidd , said at the team 's practice yesterday , recalling the time he appeared in a high-school all-star tournament with Dare . '' <br><blue>16</blue>Unfortunately , his N.B.A. career never took off . '' <br><blue>17</blue>The Nets ' Kerry Kittles said yesterday : '' He was a big guy , strong and physical , but he was very raw and unpolished . <br><blue>18</blue>He could have used some more time to develop his skills . <br><blue>19</blue>At this level , you have to come in ready to play , and he never got that early break to learn a little bit first .
