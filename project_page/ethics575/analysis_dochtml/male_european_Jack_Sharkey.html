<blue>1</blue>Jack Sharkey , the bantering , cocksure boxer who captured the world heavyweight championship in an unlikely victory over Max Schmeling in 1932 and relinquished it a year and eight days later in an even less likely loss to Primo Carnera , died on Wednesday at the Beverly , Mass. , hospital . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 91 years old and had been the oldest former heavyweight champion . <br><blue>3</blue>His family said the cause of death was respiratory arrest . <br><blue>4</blue>For all the glory of his yearlong reign as champion , Sharkey 's entire 13-year career was studded with bright-line footnotes to the Golden Age of Boxing . <br><blue>5</blue>Among other things , his battered body served as the lone bridge between successive eras . <br><blue>6</blue>He was at once the only man to have faced two sets of champions who never fought each other , Jack Dempsey and Schmeling and Dempsey and Joe Louis . <br><blue>7</blue>Sharkey-Dempsey in 1927 Partly because he had changed his Lithuanian name to win acceptance in the Irish-dominated boxing world of Boston and partly because he was a bit better at boasting than he was at boxing , Sharkey was as hated as Dempsey was beloved when the two faced each other at Yankee Stadium on July 21 , 1927 . <br><blue>8</blue>Through the first six rounds , the resounding boos that had greeted Sharkey 's introduction were largely stilled as it became painfully obvious that the 32-year-old Dempsey , who had lost the championship to Gene Tunney the previous September , was no match for the 24-year-old Sharkey . <br><blue>9</blue>Then in the seventh , Dempsey , swinging furiously , landed a low right and Sharkey , clutching his midriff , turned to the referee to complain . <br><blue>10</blue>While he was looking away , Dempsey landed a haymaker that knocked Sharkey into the middle of the previous morning . <br><blue>11</blue>After he revived , Sharkey reminded his manager that he was to fight Dempsey that night . <br><blue>12</blue>No Apologies From Dempsey For Dempsey , the knockout was the last victory of his career , and he did not apologize for it . <br><blue>13</blue>When asked why he had hit a man who was n't looking , Dempsey replied , " What was I supposed to do , mail him a letter ? " <br><blue>14</blue>Sharkey 's first title fight also featured a famous low blow and his last produced an even more famous complaint . <br><blue>15</blue>On June 12 , 1930 , fighting Schmeling for the title that had been vacant since Tunney 's retirement two years earlier , Sharkey landed a low blow in the fourth round , knocking Schmeling out , but giving the German the title by foul . <br><blue>16</blue>Within months , New York State boxing authorities abolished the foul rule . <br><blue>17</blue>From then on , the penalty for a low blow was a loss of round and any resulting knockouts were allowed to stand . <br><blue>18</blue>Two years later , after fighting Mickey Walker to a famous draw and winning a decision over Carnera in 1931 , Sharkey fought Schmeling again , on June 21 , 1932 , winning the title in a controversial split decision that drew boos from the crowd and a legendary lament from Schmeling 's manager , Joe Jacobs , who shouted into the radio microphone , " We wuz robbed . " <br><blue>19</blue>Knocked Out by Canera Sharkey did not defend his title until a year later , when Carnera , a half-foot taller at 6-6 , landed a stunning right-hand uppercut that knocked Sharkey out in the sixth round . <br><blue>20</blue>After two more losses , Sharkey retired , but made a comeback in late 1935 that lasted until Aug. 18 , 1936 , when he faced a young boxer named Joe Louis , who had been knocked out by Schmeling just two months earlier . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Boston</m_str> (7_21) 	<br><blue>2(35)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (7_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_25) 	<m_str>Sharkey 's</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>Sharkey</m_str> (15_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_33) 	<m_str>Sharkey</m_str> (7_38) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Sharkey</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>His family</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>the 24-year-old Sharkey</m_str> (8_45) 	<m_str>Sharkey</m_str> (10_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>Sharkey</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>Sharkey</m_str> (18_22) 	<m_str>by Canera Sharkey</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>Sharkey 's</m_str> (4_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>Sharkey</m_str> (20_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>Sharkey</m_str> (19_32) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_25) 	<m_str>Sharkey 's</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (13_26) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_6) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Sharkey 's introduction</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (8_20) 	<br><blue>4(9)</blue>: <m_str>Dempsey</m_str> (6_26) 	<m_str>Dempsey</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (13_20) 	<m_str>Dempsey</m_str> (7_43) 	<m_str>Dempsey For Dempsey</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>the 32-year-old Dempsey , who had lost the championship to Gene Tunney the previous September</m_str> (8_25) 	<m_str>Dempsey</m_str> (11_14) 	<m_str>Dempsey</m_str> (13_14) 	<m_str>the seventh , Dempsey , swinging furiously</m_str> (9_3) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Sharkey 's entire 13-year career</m_str> (4_12) 	<m_str>his career</m_str> (12_15) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Carnera</m_str> (18_18) 	<m_str>Carnera , a half-foot taller at 6-6</m_str> (19_17) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>the championship</m_str> (8_32) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (1_26) 	<m_str>the world heavyweight championship in an unlikely victory</m_str> (1_11) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (12_24) 	<m_str>the knockout</m_str> (12_8) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>a famous low blow</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>a low blow</m_str> (15_26) 	<m_str>a low blow</m_str> (17_8) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the sixth round</m_str> (19_35) 	<m_str>the fourth round</m_str> (15_30) 	<br><blue>11(7)</blue>: <m_str>Schmeling</m_str> (15_35) 	<m_str>Max Schmeling</m_str> (1_20) 	<m_str>Schmeling 's</m_str> (18_52) 	<m_str>Schmeling</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>Schmeling</m_str> (18_24) 	<m_str>Schmeling just two months earlier</m_str> (20_40) 	<m_str>Schmeling</m_str> (6_24) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>We</m_str> (18_67) 	<m_str>Schmeling 's manager , Joe Jacobs , who shouted into the radio microphone</m_str> (18_52) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
