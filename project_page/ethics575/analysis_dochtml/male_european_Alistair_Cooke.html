<blue>1</blue>Alistair Cooke , the urbane and erudite British-born journalist who became a peerless observer of the American scene for more than 70 years , died at his home in Manhattan , the BBC said yesterday . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 95 . <br><blue>3</blue>A BBC spokesman said Mr. Cooke 's daughter , Susan Cooke Kittredge , had contacted Mr. Cooke 's biographer , a BBC reporter , Nick Clarke , to inform him of her father 's death at midnight . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Cooke was widely known to American television audiences as the host of the pioneer cultural program '' Omnibus '' in the 1950 's and later as the imperturbable and honey-voiced host of the long-running '' Masterpiece Theater '' on public television . <br><blue>5</blue>But his journalistic career went well beyond the television screen . <br><blue>6</blue>A veteran foreign correspondent and a successful and prolific author , he was celebrated for his '' Letter From America , '' which the BBC broadcast weekly to more than 50 countries . <br><blue>7</blue>Begun in 1946 , the series of 13-minute essays continued , with only an occasional break , for 58 years . <br><blue>8</blue>This year , with Mr. Cooke in failing health , his doctors advised him to retire . <br><blue>9</blue>His last letter , No. 2,869 , an observation on the issues shaping the American presidential campaign , was broadcast on Feb. 20 . <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Cooke wrote his intentions for the program in a memo to the BBC in February 1946 . '' <br><blue>11</blue>It will be a weekly personal letter to a Briton by a fireside , I shall try to give a running commentary on topical aspects of American life , some of the intimate background to Washington policy , some profiles of important Americans . <br><blue>12</blue>The stress will tend always to be on the springs of American life , whose bubbles are the headlines , rather than on the headlines themselves . '' <br><blue>13</blue>The BBC liked the idea , and the first program went out on the network 's Home Service on March 24 of that year . <br><blue>14</blue>Writing in The Sunday Times of London on the 50th anniversary of that first broadcast , Paul Donovan said : '' Amazingly , almost nothing about the program has changed in half a century ; it still goes out on a Sunday , is still between 13 and 14 minutes long , is still composed on a manual typewriter and is still free , uniquely , from BBC editorial control . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Insight and Wit Mr. Cooke 's weekly radio talks gained him a reputation as one of the most effective interpreters of the American way of life to the world . <br><blue>16</blue>His observations were not only insightful but also gracefully written and often gently witty . <br><blue>17</blue>Here he is on the defeat of the great middleweight boxer Sugar Ray Robinson at Madison Square Garden in 1962 : '' When it was over , Sugar Ray flexed his calves for the last time and did a little hobbling dance over to embrace the victor , who was pink and sweaty and very happy , identifiable on the score card as Denny Moyer of Portland , Ore. , but on closer inspection was that bearded figure with a scythe Sugar Ray had dreaded to meet . '' <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Cooke first gained a large American audience as the elegant host of '' Omnibus , '' the legendary magazine of the arts that appeared on all three major commercial networks over its lifetime , from 1952 to 1961 . <br><blue>19</blue>His long association with the public-television series '' Masterpiece Theater '' began in 1971 . <br><blue>20</blue>He was proud that he personally wrote the succinct and often highly informative introductions to those British-made television dramas . <br><hr><br><blue>1(29)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_27) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Cooke 's</m_str> (3_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Cooke 's daughter , Susan Cooke Kittredge</m_str> (3_5) 	<m_str>Susan Cooke Kittredge</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Cooke 's</m_str> (3_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Cooke 's biographer , a BBC reporter , Nick Clarke</m_str> (3_16) 	<m_str>Nick Clarke</m_str> (3_25) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (3_30) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_32) 	<m_str>her father 's</m_str> (3_32) 	<m_str>Mr. Cooke</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_16) 	<m_str>Mr. Cooke in failing health</m_str> (8_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Cooke</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_4) 	<m_str>Wit Mr. Cooke 's</m_str> (15_3) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_11) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Cooke</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_5) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (17_24) 	<m_str>the defeat of the great middleweight boxer Sugar Ray Robinson at Madison Square Garden in 1962 : '' When it was over , Sugar Ray flexed his calves for the last time and did a little hobbling dance over to embrace the victor , who was pink and sweaty and very happy , identifiable on the score card as Denny Moyer of Portland , Ore. , but on closer inspection was that bearded figure with a scythe Sugar Ray had dreaded to meet</m_str> (17_5) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (17_31) 	<m_str>a scythe Sugar Ray</m_str> (17_80) 	<m_str>Sugar Ray</m_str> (17_28) 	<br><blue>4(4)</blue>: <m_str>the program in a memo</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>the first program</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_36) 	<m_str>the program</m_str> (14_27) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>58 years</m_str> (7_19) 	<m_str>This year</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>that year</m_str> (13_23) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>America</m_str> (6_20) 	<br><blue>7(6)</blue>: <m_str>the BBC</m_str> (1_32) 	<m_str>BBC</m_str> (3_2) 	<m_str>BBC</m_str> (3_22) 	<m_str>BBC</m_str> (6_25) 	<m_str>The BBC</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>BBC</m_str> (14_68) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
