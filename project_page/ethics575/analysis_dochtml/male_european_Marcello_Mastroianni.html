         <h1>Marcello Mastroianni, Self-Deprecating Charmer of Italian Film, Is Dead at 72 </h1>
           <div class="row">
               <div class="col-md-10">
 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>Marcello Mastroianni , the Italian actor whose diffident but romantic charm made him one of the movies ' best-loved Latin lovers and whose keen dramatic sense made him an international star in such films as '' La Dolce Vita '' and '' 8 1/2 , '' died today at his home in Paris . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 72 and also had a home in Rome . <br><blue>3</blue>Italian news agencies reported today that he had suffered from cancer of the pancreas . <br><blue>4</blue>No cause of death was officially given . <br><blue>5</blue>Enzo Biagi , an Italian journalist and friend who said he last saw Mr. Mastroianni two months ago walking with a cane , added that the actor had not wanted people to know he was ill because it might prevent him from working . <br><blue>6</blue>He continued to act until two months ago , touring Italy in a production of '' The Last Moons , '' a play about heartbreak and old age . <br><blue>7</blue>At the height of his career , which embraced over 120 films , Mr. Mastroianni was the exemplar of modern man facing the existential void . <br><blue>8</blue>In Fellini 's '' Dolce Vita '' and '' 8 1/2 '' and in Michelangelo Antonioni 's bleak '' La Notte , '' he portrayed individuals searching for the keys to their lives . <br><blue>9</blue>He was equally skilled at comedy , sometimes verging on slapstick , in films like '' Divorce , Italian Style . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Writing about the teamwork between Mr. Mastroianni and a frequent co-star , Sophia Loren , in Ettore Scola 's 1977 film '' A Special Day , '' in which Mr. Mastroianni was cast as a suicidal homosexual facing arrest by Fascist officials , the New York Times film critic Vincent Canby praised their style and self-assurance . <br><blue>11</blue>He wrote : '' One of the qualities that both Miss Loren and Mr. Mastroianni have as performers -- and something that , perhaps , all great performers share -- is a way of presenting the surface characteristics of a role ( the gestures , expressions , language ) while also somehow making a comment on those characteristics . '' <br><blue>12</blue>Of Mr. Mastroianni 's work in Nikita Mikhalkov 's '' Dark Eyes , '' which opened the 25th New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center in 1987 , Mr. Canby wrote : '' The physical transformation of the actor in the course of the movie is something miraculous , accomplished without visible makeup , through the resources of a remarkable performer and , of course , through the opportunities of a richly written role . '' <br><blue>13</blue>Surveying the actor 's career , Mr. Canby added , '' Mr. Mastroianni and the festival have had their ups and downs -- and they 're still here , Mr. Mastroianni triumphantly so . '' <br><blue>14</blue>In Italy , where he was respected as one of the last giants of the golden age of Italian film but also affectionately embraced for his lighthearted , unassuming ways , Mr. Mastroianni was mourned today at all levels of society -- from Government officials to the waiters at the restaurant in the Trastevere quarter where Mr. Mastroianni had an apartment . <br><blue>15</blue>The city of Rome dimmed the lights and shut off the water tonight at the Trevi Fountain in honor of the scene in '' La Dolce Vita '' where Mr. Mastroianni , as a young intellectual who wanders into decadent cafe society , joins the Swedish actress Anita Ekberg for a midnight splash in the fountain basin . <br><blue>16</blue>A crowd listened silently while a musician played themes from '' 8 1/2 '' on a wooden flute . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Mastroianni played the leading man to a succession of beautiful women . <br><blue>18</blue>But his most famous partnership was with Miss Loren , who alternately married , divorced , seduced and pined after him in a total of 12 movies . <br><blue>19</blue>Of these , the most famous were '' Marriage , Italian Style , '' '' The Priest 's Wife '' and '' Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow . '' <br><blue>20</blue>Their last collaboration was in Robert Altman 's 1994 movie on the fashion industry , '' Pret-a-Porter '' ( '' Ready-to-Wear '' ) . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Rome</m_str> (2_10) 	<m_str>Rome</m_str> (15_4) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the keys</m_str> (8_28) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (8_31) 	<br><blue>3(35)</blue>: <m_str>him</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (1_28) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_49) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>the actor</m_str> (5_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_34) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (5_38) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (5_41) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>Fellini 's</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_23) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni</m_str> (10_30) 	<m_str>the New York Times film critic Vincent Canby</m_str> (10_44) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni</m_str> (11_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni 's</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Canby</m_str> (12_29) 	<m_str>the actor 's</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Canby</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>still here , Mr. Mastroianni triumphantly so</m_str> (13_27) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_26) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni</m_str> (14_32) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni</m_str> (14_57) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni , as a young intellectual who wanders into decadent cafe society</m_str> (15_30) 	<m_str>Mr. Mastroianni</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_2) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (18_21) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (13_19) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (13_25) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Italy</m_str> (6_11) 	<m_str>Italy</m_str> (14_2) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
