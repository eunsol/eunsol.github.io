<blue>1</blue>Louis Malle , the eclectic French director of films including " Pretty Baby , " " Lacombe , Lucien , " " Atlantic City , " " My Dinner With Andre " and " Au Revoir les Enfants , " died on Thursday at his home in Beverly Hills , Calif . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 63 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was lymphoma , said Pat Kingsley , press representative for Mr. Malle 's wife , the actress Candice Bergen . <br><blue>4</blue>There is no single Malle look or sound , nor is there a single , continuing Malle preoccupation to match the extravagant self-absorption of a director like Federico Fellini , Vincent Canby concluded when he was the chief film critic of The New York Times . <br><blue>5</blue>" Instead , " Mr. Canby wrote , " there is something far more elusive that connects each succeeding Malle film to the ones that preceded it . <br><blue>6</blue>That is best described as a combination of things -- a strong streak of romanticism , a clear-eyed , almost scientific curiosity about the behavior of individuals and the nature of their relationship with each other and the world they inhabit , a comic skepticism about all things most of us take for granted , including sexual mores . " <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Malle did not consider himself a born film maker , and he worked hard to master the art . <br><blue>8</blue>He regarded himself always as an outsider , and the characters he created frequently seemed to be outsiders , too : characters gazing out windows , peeping through Venetian blinds , being unvarnished voyeurs . <br><blue>9</blue>For him , his craft was an exercise in voyeurism . <br><blue>10</blue>His films often reflected his fascination with big suspended moments when something is going to happen and things are not going to be the same . <br><blue>11</blue>Thus " Lacombe , Lucien " depicts a France caught between Occupation and liberation ; " Murmurs of the Heart " traces a delicate transistion from adolescence to maturity ; " Pretty Baby " relates the story of a child prostitute whose coming of age coincides with the closing down of the red-light district of New Orleans , and " Atlantic City " explores the city when the elegant old hotels were coming down and the flashy new casinos were going up . <br><blue>12</blue>If Mr. Malle had a knack for catching the spirit and the habits of ordinary people , his pedigree was anything but ordinary . <br><blue>13</blue>He was born in Thumeries in northern France , one of seven children of Francoise Beghin and Pierre Malle . <br><blue>14</blue>His mother , whom he described as " an extremely conventional woman " who went to Mass " every day of her life , " was the heir to a fortune derived from sugar . <br><blue>15</blue>Young Louis had all the advantages great wealth can bring . <br><blue>16</blue>As a boy , he summered in Ireland and became fluent in English . <br><blue>17</blue>Indeed , there were times in his later life when , he said , English seemed to come easier to him than French . <br><blue>18</blue>His Jesuit-run school in Paris was rigorous . <br><blue>19</blue>In 1944 , with Paris a likely objective of Allied forces determined to liberate it from German Occupation , he was sent to a Catholic boarding school in nearby Fontainebleau , seemingly a safer place . <br><blue>20</blue>It was run by Carmelite monks who were active in the Resistance . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Atlantic City</m_str> (11_61) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>France</m_str> (13_8) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>English</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>English</m_str> (16_13) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Paris</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (19_5) 	<br><blue>5(6)</blue>: <m_str>Federico Fellini</m_str> (4_28) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Vincent Canby</m_str> (4_31) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_35) 	<m_str>Mr. Canby</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_45) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Resistance</m_str> (20_11) 	<br><blue>7(29)</blue>: <m_str>Young Louis</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (8_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_7) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (17_21) 	<m_str>Pat Kingsley , press representative for Mr. Malle 's wife , the actress Candice Bergen</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>Lucien</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Malle 's</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>Malle</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Malle</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>Malle</m_str> (4_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>Malle</m_str> (5_20) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Pierre Malle</m_str> (13_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Malle</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (7_6) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (19_15) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (5_27) 	<m_str>each succeeding Malle film to the ones that preceded it</m_str> (5_18) 	<br><blue>10(3)</blue>: <m_str>individuals</m_str> (6_27) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (6_32) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (6_40) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
