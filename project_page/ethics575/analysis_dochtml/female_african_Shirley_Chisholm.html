<blue>1</blue>Shirley Chisholm , the first black woman to serve in Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination , died on Saturday night at her home in Ormond Beach , Fla . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 80 . <br><blue>3</blue>She died after several recent strokes , according to a former staff member , William Howard . <br><blue>4</blue>Mrs. Chisholm was an outspoken , steely educator-turned-politician who shattered racial and gender barriers as she became a national symbol of liberal politics in the 1960 's and 1970 's . <br><blue>5</blue>Over the years , she also had a way of making statements that angered the establishment , as in 1974 , when she asserted that '' there is an undercurrent of resistance '' to integration '' among many blacks in areas of concentrated poverty and discrimination , '' including in her own district in Brooklyn . '' <br><blue>6</blue>Just wait , there may be some fireworks , '' she declared after winning her seat in Congress in 1968 with an upset victory in Brooklyn 's 12th Congressional District , which had been created by court-ordered reapportionment . <br><blue>7</blue>Her slogan was '' unbought and unbossed '' -- in the primary , she had defeated two other candidates , William C. Thompson , who she maintained was the candidate of the Brooklyn Democratic organization , and Dolly Robinson . '' <br><blue>8</blue>The party leaders do not like me , '' Mrs. Chisholm said at the time . <br><blue>9</blue>But about 80 percent of the registered voters in the district , which included her own neighborhood , Bedford-Stuyvesant , were Democrats . <br><blue>10</blue>That edge helped her in her race against James Farmer , a leader of the freedom rides in the south in the early 1960 's , who ran as an independent on the Republican and Liberal lines , and Ralph Carrano , who ran as the Conservative candidate . '' <br><blue>11</blue>I am an historical person at this point , and I 'm very much aware of it , '' she told The Washington Post a few months after she was sworn in . <br><blue>12</blue>Soon she was challenging the seniority system in the House , which had relegated her to its Agriculture Committee , an assignment she criticized as irrelevant to an urban district like hers . '' <br><blue>13</blue>Apparently all they know here in Washington about Brooklyn is that a tree grew there , '' she said in a statement at the time . '' <br><blue>14</blue>Only nine black people have been elected to Congress , and those nine should be used as effectively as possible . '' <br><blue>15</blue>She said that the House speaker , John W. McCormack , had told her to '' be a good soldier '' and accept the agriculture assignment . <br><blue>16</blue>Instead , she fired a parliamentary salvo at the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , Wilbur D. Mills , who gave out committee assignments . <br><blue>17</blue>Before long , she was reassigned , first to the Veterans Affairs Committee and later to the Education and Labor Committees . <br><blue>18</blue>Winning a better committee assignment did not make her any less acerbic on the workings of Washington . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Our representative democracy is not working , '' she wrote in a 1970 book that borrowed her campaign slogan as its title , '' because the Congress that is supposed to represent the voters does not respond to their needs . <br><blue>20</blue>I believe the chief reason for this is that it is ruled by a small group of old men .
