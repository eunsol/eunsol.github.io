<blue>1</blue>Shintaro Abe , one of Japan 's top politicians for nearly two decades and leader of an influential faction of the governing Liberal Democratic Party , died today after a two-year illness . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 67 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>There have been reports , never confirmed , that he suffered from cancer . <br><blue>4</blue>Party officials reported that he died of heart failure . <br><blue>5</blue>His health was also said to have been failing since he underwent bile-duct surgery two years ago . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Abe , a former journalist who once sought to become a kamikaze pilot , was groomed to become Prime Minister , holding every top job in his party and a number of important Cabinet posts . <br><blue>7</blue>He was Japan 's longest-serving postwar Foreign Minister , holding the post from 1982 through 1986 , during a time when Japanese-American relations generally grew closer . <br><blue>8</blue>Done In by Scandal But Mr. Abe fell just short of his political goal when he was caught up in a major influence-peddling scandal , derailing his long and steady climb toward the prime ministership . <br><blue>9</blue>His involvement in the Recruit scandal of 1988 , in which a political secretary accepted unlisted shares in a company seeking influence among top politicians , eliminated him from the race to run the Government . <br><blue>10</blue>But he continued to lead the second-largest faction in the Liberal Democratic Party . <br><blue>11</blue>Along with Noboru Takeshita , a former Prime Minister who heads the party 's largest faction , Mr. Abe exerted great influence over Japanese politics . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1989 he became ill , and despite constant suggestions that he might again be considered for the Prime Minister 's job , his deteriorating health made that seem unlikely . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Abe was born on April 29 , 1924 , in Yamaguchi Prefecture , in western Japan . <br><blue>14</blue>His father became mayor of his hometown and then was elected to Parliament in 1936 as a conservative . <br><blue>15</blue>After graduating from high school early in 1944 , Mr. Abe entered a naval aviation school and volunteered to become a kamikaze pilot . <br><blue>16</blue>But the war ended before he could undergo special training , and he went on to obtain a law degree from Tokyo University in 1949 . <br><blue>17</blue>After graduation , he became a political reporter for Mainichi Shimbun , a leading national daily . <br><blue>18</blue>His political career began when he married into a prominent political family . <br><blue>19</blue>In 1951 , he wed Yoko Kishi , the daughter of Nobusuke Kishi , who became Prime Minister a few years later . <br><blue>20</blue>Elected to Parliament Mr. Abe left journalism in 1956 when his father-in-law was appointed Foreign Minister , and served as his secretary . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the second-largest faction</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>the party 's largest faction</m_str> (11_12) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>a political secretary</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>his secretary</m_str> (20_21) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Japan 's</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>Japan 's</m_str> (7_3) 	<br><blue>4(4)</blue>: <m_str>Liberal Democratic Party</m_str> (1_23) 	<m_str>his party</m_str> (6_28) 	<m_str>the Liberal Democratic Party</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>the party 's</m_str> (11_12) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Nobusuke Kishi</m_str> (19_12) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Parliament</m_str> (14_13) 	<m_str>Parliament</m_str> (20_3) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Prime Minister 's job</m_str> (12_18) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>the prime ministership</m_str> (8_33) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>Recruit</m_str> (9_5) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>a major influence-peddling scandal</m_str> (8_21) 	<m_str>the Recruit scandal of 1988</m_str> (9_4) 	<br><blue>11(31)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_28) 	<m_str>Mr. Abe , a former journalist who once sought to become a kamikaze pilot</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Abe</m_str> (8_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_27) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (9_28) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Abe</m_str> (11_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_24) 	<m_str>Mr. Abe</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Abe</m_str> (15_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_21) 	<br><blue>12(1)</blue>: <m_str>Foreign Minister</m_str> (20_15) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
