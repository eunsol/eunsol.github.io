<blue>1</blue>Dame Catherine Cookson , a determined dockside waif who spun the dross of a squalid childhood into gold as one of Britain 's most prolific and best-read novelists , died yesterday at her home in a Newcastle suburb . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 91 and the author of more than 90 novels with a combined distribution of more than 100 million copies . <br><blue>3</blue>There 's not much to be said for growing up coal poor in Tyneside , the industrial banks of the Tyne in northeastern England , even less for being shamed by an alcoholic mother and never knowing your father . <br><blue>4</blue>Then again , by the time she was finished , Dame Catherine had said quite a lot about the grim life she knew as a girl and illuminated in scores of novels , almost all of them set in the same working-class world she grew up dreaming of escaping . <br><blue>5</blue>British readers have not seemed to be able to get enough of Dame Catherine 's gritty tales of family conflict , social despair and the debilitating effects of deprivation . <br><blue>6</blue>Dame Catherine has not only regularly accounted for a third of the books circulated by Britain 's lending libraries , but of the top 10 titles on last year 's circulation list , nine were hers . <br><blue>7</blue>Yet she would have been hard-pressed to dream up a more unlikely heroine or a tale as compelling as the story of her own life . <br><blue>8</blue>Who , after all , would believe that a woman whose childhood humiliations included frequenting pawn shops , collecting driftwood from the Tyne , being sexually molested at 7 by her mother 's boyfriend , and making daily runs to the pub to fetch her mother and tyrannical grandfather pails of beer would become a successful novelist ? <br><blue>9</blue>Or that a woman whose adult tribulations would include the pain of four pregnancies ending in miscarriage and stillbirth and a devastating nervous breakdown would make an emotional breakthrough at 40 , find salvation through writing and end up as Britain 's 17th richest woman , with a fortune estimated at $ 23 million ? <br><blue>10</blue>Even harder to believe is that Dame Catherine credited the spark that saved her life to her persistent belief as a girl that she was a lady . <br><blue>11</blue>It was a belief , she said , that was fired when an aunt mentioned that her father , a topic she could never discuss with her imperious mother , had been a gentleman . <br><blue>12</blue>And what sort of gentleman would take his pleasure , then abandon a woman he had got with child ? <br><blue>13</blue>As the aunt explained , '' he wore an astrakhan collar , and he carried a silver-mounted walking stick and kid gloves . <br><blue>14</blue>And , oh yes , he talked lovely . '' <br><blue>15</blue>( Dame Catherine later speculated that her father had been a gentleman 's footman . ) <br><blue>16</blue>The notion that she had been born a lady took a startling turn when Dame Catherine , then known as Katie McMullen , read in a novel that it was a lady 's duty to be educated , which she took to heart , beginning a lifelong habit of reading great books . <br><blue>17</blue>She found her immediate escape from poverty by working in laundries , rising to supervisor , saving her money , moving to the southeastern city of Hastings and opening a rooming house for men . <br><blue>18</blue>One of her lodgers was a shy , intellectual school teacher named Tom Cookson , and as Dame Catherine later told it , it was close to love at first sight . <br><blue>19</blue>When she asked him in for coffee after their first movie date , the two sat up talking until after midnight . '' <br><blue>20</blue>Now , '' she said , '' whether it was him , or whether it was me who first leaned to the other I do n't know . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>an aunt</m_str> (11_13) 	<m_str>the aunt</m_str> (13_2) 	<br><blue>2(6)</blue>: <m_str>gentleman</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_6) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Tyne</m_str> (3_20) 	<m_str>the Tyne</m_str> (8_22) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>a girl</m_str> (4_25) 	<m_str>a girl</m_str> (10_21) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>her immediate escape</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (18_22) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (18_24) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>your father</m_str> (3_38) 	<m_str>her father</m_str> (15_7) 	<br><blue>7(34)</blue>: <m_str>Dame Catherine Cookson , a determined dockside waif who spun the dross of a squalid childhood into gold as one of Britain 's most prolific and best-read novelists</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>Dame Catherine</m_str> (4_11) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_22) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_44) 	<m_str>Dame Catherine 's</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>hers</m_str> (6_36) 	<m_str>Dame Catherine</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_23) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_31) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_45) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_24) 	<m_str>Dame Catherine</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_17) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_17) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_22) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_27) 	<m_str>Dame Catherine</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_4) 	<m_str>Dame Catherine , then known as Katie McMullen</m_str> (16_15) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_40) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_18) 	<m_str>Dame Catherine</m_str> (18_18) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_4) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>The notion</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (16_29) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>a lady 's</m_str> (16_31) 	<m_str>a lady</m_str> (16_8) 	<br><blue>10(3)</blue>: <m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (1_22) 	<m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (6_16) 	<m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (9_41) 	<br><blue>11(4)</blue>: <m_str>an alcoholic mother</m_str> (3_32) 	<m_str>her mother</m_str> (8_45) 	<m_str>her mother 's</m_str> (8_31) 	<m_str>her imperious mother</m_str> (11_27) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (20_15) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>me</m_str> (20_17) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (20_24) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
