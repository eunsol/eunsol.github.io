         <h1>Jean-Pierre Rampal, Virtuoso Flutist Who Achieved Success as a Soloist, Is Dead at 78 </h1>

 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>Jean-Pierre Rampal , the French-born flutist who was the first virtuoso on his instrument to enjoy enormous success and celebrity as a touring soloist and who almost single-handedly took the flute to new levels of popularity in the decades after World War II , died yesterday at his home in Paris . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 78 and had been ill with a heart condition for some time . <br><blue>3</blue>Other important flutists had managed to lift themselves from the ranks of orchestral and chamber players and achieve success as soloists , starting with the flutist and composer Johann Joachim Quantz in the 18th century . <br><blue>4</blue>Two master French flutists earlier in the 20th century , Georges Barrere and Marcel Moyse , were also known for solo work , especially Moyse , who '' opened the door for us , '' Mr. Rampal used to say . <br><blue>5</blue>But Mr. Rampal was the first flutist to attain the kind of visibility and presence that previously had gone only to virtuoso pianists and violinists . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Rampal regularly filled the world 's largest concert halls , even at times the Hollywood Bowl , for his recitals and chamber music performances , and in his prime he gave more than 100 concerts a year . <br><blue>7</blue>One of the most-recorded and best-selling classical instrumentalists in history , he was a proud trailblazer in the crossover genre . <br><blue>8</blue>His CBS Masterworks recording of Claude Bolling 's Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano , released in 1975 , made the Billboard chart of top-selling albums for 10 consecutive years , only the second time the 10-year milestone had been reached , the first being Pink Floyd 's '' Dark Side of the Moon . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Rampal 's popularity was grounded in qualities that won him consistent praise from critics and musicians in the first decades of his career : solid musicianship , technical command , uncanny breath control , and a distinctive tone that eschewed Romantic richness and warm vibrato in favor of clarity , radiance , focus and a wide palette of colorings . <br><blue>10</blue>Younger flutists assiduously studied and tried to copy his approaches to tonguing , fingering , embouchure ( the position of the lips on the mouthpiece ) and breathing . <br><blue>11</blue>Reviewing Mr. Rampal 's performance in Mozart 's Concerto for Flute and Harp with the New York Philharmonic in 1976 , the New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote , '' Mr. Rampal , with his effortless long line , his sweet and pure tone and his sensitive musicianship , is of course one of the great flutists in history . '' <br><blue>12</blue>Later in his career , Mr. Rampal was often faulted by critics for resting on his laurels and cutting musical corners , giving performances that sometimes seemed listless , uninvolved and sloppy . <br><blue>13</blue>But when he emerged in the late 1940 's and for years thereafter he was an indisputably major artist . <br><blue>14</blue>His entrance into concert life coincided with a revival of interest in Baroque music , which Mr. Rampal championed . <br><blue>15</blue>Still , much of his popularity came from his presence and energy as a performer . <br><blue>16</blue>At 6 feet 1 inch , with a bearlike build and erect stance , he looked imposing when he walked on stage . <br><blue>17</blue>But once he started to play , he seemed the essence of French elegance , taste and poise . <br><blue>18</blue>As recently as 1998 , at a concert in Boston 's Symphony Hall , though Mr. Rampal was recuperating from knee surgery , fighting a cold and clearly uncomfortable , his performance moved the Boston Globe critic Richard Dyer to note that '' the level of Mr. Rampal 's skill and the charm of his personality '' had not changed . <br><blue>19</blue>Though his background would seem to have preordained him for a musical career , Mr. Rampal was late in his commitment to it . <br><blue>20</blue>He was born on Jan. 7 , 1922 , in Marseilles , France , where his father , Joseph , was a professor of flute at the music conservatory and his mother , Andree , badly wanted her son to become a doctor . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Marcel Moyse</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>Moyse</m_str> (4_25) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>his father , Joseph</m_str> (20_16) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Rampal 's popularity</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>his popularity</m_str> (15_5) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Mozart 's</m_str> (11_7) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>his background</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (19_23) 	<br><blue>6(15)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (11_37) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_42) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_48) 	<m_str>the New York Times critic Harold C.
