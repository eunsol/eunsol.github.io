<blue>1</blue>Edward J. Patten , who served nine terms as a Democratic Congressman from New Jersey and retired in 1981 after a political career of nearly five decades , died on Saturday at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison , N.J . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 89 and lived in Perth Amboy . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was complications from surgery last week , said Brendan Flynn of the Flynn and Son Funeral Home in Perth Amboy . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Patten was elected Mayor of Perth Amboy in 1934 . <br><blue>5</blue>He spent 6 years in that post , 14 years as Middlesex County Clerk and 8 years as New Jersey Secretary of State . <br><blue>6</blue>He won election to the House for the first time in 1962 , representing his state 's 15th Congressional District . <br><blue>7</blue>A stalwart in the Democratic machine headed by David T. Wilentz , Mr. Patten was elected after pledging " 100 percent support " of President John F. Kennedy . <br><blue>8</blue>By 1973 , however , he was refusing to define himself by the conventional political labels of liberal , conservative or moderate . <br><blue>9</blue>He preferred the broader epithet " metropolitan . " <br><blue>10</blue>In an interview in that year he said , " When it comes to helping people , I found that many Republicans in the New Jersey-New York area tend to vote the same as us Democrats do . " <br><blue>11</blue>By 1976 , although he had scored high marks with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. 's Committee on Political Education , his constituents were reported to be moving to the right , and so was he . <br><blue>12</blue>As a Congressman , Mr. Patten had an easy time winning re-election until 1978 , when he narrowly escaped defeat at the polls . <br><blue>13</blue>That was when he and many other House members were found to have received favors from Tongsun Park , the South Korean lobbyist and intelligence agent who was accused of buying influence in Washington for his Government . <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Park admitted that he had given Mr. Patten $ 500 in the form of contributions to the annual picnic of the Middlesex County Democratic Party . <br><blue>15</blue>Early in 1980 , after the Middlesex County Democratic organization indicated that it was searching for a replacement for him , Mr. Patten announced that he would not seek re-election . <br><blue>16</blue>At that time , he was the only New Jerseyan with a seat on the House Appropriations Committee . <br><blue>17</blue>Shortly after leaving New Jersey 's Congressional delegation in early 1981 , he said in an interview that he had learned during his years in Congress that the wise course was to be " low-profiled , selfless , to regard your constituents as sacred and do n't shoot your mouth off on every issue . <br><blue>18</blue>Fellows who do that only get defeated . " <br><blue>19</blue>A native of Perth Amboy , Mr. Patten graduated from Newark Normal School , which later became Newark State College , Rutgers University and the New Jersey Law School . <br><blue>20</blue>He maintained a private law practice in Perth Amboy , and taught public school there , through 1934 . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Middlesex County Democratic organization</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (15_13) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>his constituents</m_str> (11_19) 	<m_str>your constituents</m_str> (17_41) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>State</m_str> (5_23) 	<m_str>his state 's</m_str> (6_15) 	<br><blue>4(29)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Patten</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>Mr. Patten</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_6) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (10_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_33) 	<m_str>Mr. Patten</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_36) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Park</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Patten</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_20) 	<m_str>Mr. Patten</m_str> (15_22) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_23) 	<m_str>Mr. Patten</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>New Jersey</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>New Jersey</m_str> (5_19) 	<m_str>New Jersey 's</m_str> (17_4) 	<br><blue>6(4)</blue>: <m_str>Perth Amboy</m_str> (2_7) 	<m_str>Perth Amboy</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>Perth Amboy in 1934</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>Perth Amboy</m_str> (20_8) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Middlesex County Democratic Party</m_str> (14_22) 	<m_str>Middlesex County Democratic</m_str> (15_7) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>your</m_str> (17_49) 	<m_str>your</m_str> (17_41) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
