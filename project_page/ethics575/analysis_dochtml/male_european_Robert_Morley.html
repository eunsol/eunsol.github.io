<blue>1</blue>Robert Morley , the portly , jowly character actor of the British and American stage and screen , best known for his comically pompous and jovial roles , died yesterday at a hospital in Reading , west of London . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 84 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>He died after a stroke on Sunday afternoon at his home in Wargrave , a village near Reading , his son Sheridan Morley , a British theater critic and biographer , said in a statement issued in London . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Morley , whose career spanned well over a half-century , was not only one of the busiest actors of his time , but was also an all-around man of the theater , serving as a director and producer in addition to appearing in London and on Broadway in such plays as " Oscar Wilde " and " Edward , My Son , " the latter a drama that he co-wrote . <br><blue>5</blue>He also had roles in dozens of movies and television productions , was a regular on the television talk-show circuit , and won a devoted , almost cultlike following as the merry television commercial spokesman for British Airways in the United States in the 1970 's and early 80 's , assuring prospective travelers that " we 'll take good care of you . " <br><blue>6</blue>In real life as well as on stage and screen , Mr. Morley was famous for his often irreverent wit . <br><blue>7</blue>Of his rotund physique , for example , he once commented , " My only exercise was winding my watch , but that proved too exhausting , so now I have a self-winding watch . " <br><blue>8</blue>A Talent to Amuse An actor who refused to take himself or his profession too seriously , Mr. Morley maintained that he never aspired to greatness , preferring to be regarded as " an entertainer rather than a dedicated actor . " <br><blue>9</blue>" After all , acting is my way of earning a living , " he said with characteristic directness . <br><blue>10</blue>" There 's a legend that actors impatiently fret when they 're not acting . <br><blue>11</blue>I 've never met such an actor . <br><blue>12</blue>Good actors act to live ; they do n't live to act . <br><blue>13</blue>The keener somebody is to act , the worse actor he is . <br><blue>14</blue>It 's not a sacred call , acting . <br><blue>15</blue>It is probably a great art , but I just do n't think it is . " <br><blue>16</blue>That is why he never sought to play major Shakespearean roles after becoming a star , although he was often asked to take a fling at Falstaff , he wrote in 1967 in what he called a " reluctant autobiography . " <br><blue>17</blue>" I have the highest regard for those members of my profession who continue to act in Shakespeare 's plays , " Mr. Morley said , " but I have reached an age where I can no longer bear to watch them doing so . " <br><blue>18</blue>Stagestruck in Kindergarten Mr. Morley , who was born on May 26 , 1908 , in Semley , Wiltshire , the prototypical English character actor was the son of a career army officer , Maj. Robert Wilton Morley , and the former Gertrude Emily Fass . <br><blue>19</blue>He said he was stage-struck from the moment he acted in a kindergarten play , and early on he announced his intention to " loaf about on the stage , " an ambition that " horrified and terrified " his parents , who wanted him to be a diplomat . <br><blue>20</blue>As a compromise , he tried a business career , taking a job as a beer salesman , but gave that up after six months and entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>actors</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (10_11) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (4_45) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (1_39) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (3_38) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (12_7) 	<m_str>Good actors</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Shakespeare 's</m_str> (17_18) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>My only exercise</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>that</m_str> (7_23) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>such an actor</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>the worse actor he is</m_str> (13_8) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>those members of my profession</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (17_42) 	<br><blue>8(45)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (7_9) 	<m_str>My</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_70) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (7_19) 	<m_str>Robert Morley , the portly , jowly character actor of the British and American stage and screen</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>you</m_str> (5_63) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_4) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (7_30) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>Mr. Morley</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_22) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_22) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_15) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (17_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Kindergarten Mr. Morley , who was born on May 26 , 1908</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>Mr. Morley</m_str> (17_23) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_29) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_20) 	<m_str>his son Sheridan Morley</m_str> (3_20) 	<m_str>the prototypical English character actor</m_str> (18_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_19) 	<m_str>Maj.
