<blue>1</blue>Lana Turner , who built a successful movie career on her first screen appearance as a teen-age " sweater girl , " died yesterday . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 75 and lived in Los Angeles . <br><blue>3</blue>" She just took a breath and she was gone , " her daughter , Cheryl Crane , was quoted as saying in Daily Variety , a trade newspaper . <br><blue>4</blue>Miss Turner , who had been treated for throat cancer , apparently died of natural causes , a police spokeswoman , Ramona Baety , confirmed to The Associated Press . <br><blue>5</blue>Miss Turner was discovered in 1937 by a reporter as she sipped a soda in a Hollywood ice cream parlor while cutting a secretarial class at her high school . <br><blue>6</blue>The encounter led to her first film role , in " They Wo n't Forget . " <br><blue>7</blue>Wearing a skintight sweater and skirt , she sauntered along a street , spoke not one line , was murdered in the first reel and began a quick climb to stardom . <br><blue>8</blue>Her best performance was that of an unfulfilled wife who persuades a drifter to kill her husband , in " The Postman Always Rings Twice " ( 1946 ) . <br><blue>9</blue>Other major roles were a rebellious student in " These Glamour Girls " ( 1939 ) , a shallow performer in " Ziegfeld Girl " ( 1941 ) and an alcoholic actress in " The Bad and the Beautiful " ( 1952 ) . <br><blue>10</blue>Recalling " The Bad and the Beautiful , " John Houseman , the producer , said he and Vincente Minnelli , the director , had agreed Miss Turner " was capable of brilliant individual scenes , but seemed to lack the temperament or the training to sustain a full-length performance . " <br><blue>11</blue>" This made our episodic film just right for her , " Mr. Houseman said . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Minnelli recalled using " many ruses and subterfuges " to extract a major performance from Miss Turner , adding , " As she got more into the picture her nervousness disappeared , and she effectively made the character 's transition from tramp to glamour queen . " <br><blue>13</blue>The actress , a star at MGM for 17 years , was a quintessential product of the Hollywood studio system . <br><blue>14</blue>She recalled in 1969 : " It was all beauty and it was all power . <br><blue>15</blue>Once you had it made , they protected you ; they gave you stardom . <br><blue>16</blue>The ones who kept forging ahead became higher and higher and brighter and brighter and they were stars . <br><blue>17</blue>And they were treated like stars . <br><blue>18</blue>We had the best . " <br><blue>19</blue>Her stormy personal life , peppered by many marriages and publicized romances , was as lurid as many of her films , but her identity as a sex symbol served to insulate her career from scandal 's consequences . <br><blue>20</blue>The most sensational incident occurred in 1958 when her lover , Johnny Stompanato , threatened to disfigure her and was stabbed to death with a carving knife by her 14-year-old daughter , Cheryl Crane . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>her career</m_str> (19_33) 	<br><blue>2(31)</blue>: <m_str>Lana Turner , who built a successful movie career on her first screen appearance as a teen-age `` sweater girl</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_11) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (3_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (3_8) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>her daughter , Cheryl Crane</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>Cheryl Crane</m_str> (3_16) 	<m_str>Miss Turner , who had been treated for throat cancer</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Miss Turner</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_27) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>Miss Turner</m_str> (10_27) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>Miss Turner</m_str> (12_17) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_24) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_30) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_35) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_20) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_24) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_33) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_18) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_29) 	<m_str>her 14-year-old daughter , Cheryl Crane</m_str> (20_29) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>you</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>you</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>you</m_str> (15_13) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Hollywood</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>Hollywood</m_str> (13_18) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>It</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_12) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (15_4) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Vincente Minnelli</m_str> (10_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Minnelli</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>7(4)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (15_11) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (16_16) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (17_2) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>a teen-age `` sweater girl</m_str> (1_16) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>her films</m_str> (19_20) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
