<blue>1</blue>Brigitte Helm , the German actress who defined the unobtainable , cool-eyed screen vamp as the haunting teen-age star of Fritz Lang 's futuristic 1926 masterpiece , " Metropolis , " died on Tuesday in Ascona , Switzerland , where she had lived in seclusion for more than 30 years . <br><blue>2</blue>By her own account , she was 88 . <br><blue>3</blue>She was the most sought-after actress of the glory days of the German film industry , a tall blond beauty who starred in more than 35 movies and set directors against one another in the competition for her services . <br><blue>4</blue>Ms. Helm was regarded as such a perfect embodiment of the era 's ideal of cool sophistication that when she turned Josef von Sternberg down for the starring role in " Blue Angel , " he had to settle for Marlene Dietrich . <br><blue>5</blue>Yet for all the acclaim she received for such roles as her portrayal of a blind girl in Georg Wilhelm Pabst 's " Love of Jeanne Ney , " or as a bored aristocratic wanton in his " Crisis , " Ms. Helm could never eclipse the role , or rather roles , in which the good Maria , an oppressed working girl , is transformed into an evil robotic doppelganger of herself in Lang 's " Metropolis . " <br><blue>6</blue>Even today , 70 years after it was released , " Metropolis , " is not only a cult classic , it is regularly listed among the half-dozen most important films ever made . <br><blue>7</blue>This is a tribute , to be sure , to Lang 's grotesque science-fiction vision , and the array of fabulous special effects he used to bring it to the screen . <br><blue>8</blue>The film depicts the world of 2006 , a time , Lang envisioned , when a ruling class lives in decadent luxury in the lofty heights of skyscrapers linked by aerial railways , while beneath the streets slavelike workers toil in unbearable conditions to sustain their masters . <br><blue>9</blue>But for all the steam and special effects , for many who have seen the movie in its various incarnations , including a tinted version and one accompanied by music , the most compelling lingering image is neither the towers above nor the hellish factories below . <br><blue>10</blue>It is the startling transformation of Ms. Helm from an idealistic young woman into a barely clad creature performing a lascivious dance in a brothel . <br><blue>11</blue>The scene is , in a way , a reflection of Ms. Helm 's own transformation . <br><blue>12</blue>While she was a woman of rectitude who never became anything close to the vamps she portrayed on the screen , according to most accounts she was a reluctant recruit to the movies . <br><blue>13</blue>The daughter of a Prussian Army officer who died when she was a toddler , Ms. Helm , a native of Berlin whose original name was Eva Gisela Schittenhelm , was a serious , idealistic boarding school student who appeared willingly enough in school plays but who regarded movie acting with Prussian disdain as an immoral occupation on its face . <br><blue>14</blue>Then her mother , who had no such notions , sent her daughter 's photograph to Lang 's wife , the screenwriter , Thea von Harbou , and Ms. Helm , who was 16 when she was tricked into taking a screen test , was suddenly on her way to stardom . <br><blue>15</blue>While he may not have been the sadist many of his actors made him out to be , Lang was such a hard-driving perfectionist that Ms. Helm , who worked virtually every day for 18 months , often hanging upside down or standing in water up to her waist for hours at a time , found the experience excruciating . <br><blue>16</blue>After one torturous ordeal , when she wondered why a double could not have taken her place during the nine days it took to shoot a scene in which she is encased in a metallic robot shell , her face obscured , Lang haughtily claimed an auteur 's creative sensibility . <br><blue>17</blue>" I have to feel that you are inside the robot , " he said . <br><blue>18</blue>" I was able to see you even when I did n't . " <br><blue>19</blue>After the movie made her a star , Ms. Helm , who had her own artistic standards , refused to make another movie with Lang . <br><blue>20</blue>She made a successful transition to sound , but refused to abandon Germany for Hollywood . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>its face</m_str> (13_59) 	<m_str>her face</m_str> (16_39) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Germany</m_str> (20_13) 	<br><blue>3(35)</blue>: <m_str>she</m_str> (1_41) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (2_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (2_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_38) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Helm</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_20) 	<m_str>Marlene Dietrich</m_str> (4_41) 	<m_str>Ms. Helm</m_str> (5_42) 	<m_str>the good Maria , an oppressed working girl</m_str> (5_56) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_6) 	<m_str>herself</m_str> (5_73) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>Jeanne Ney</m_str> (5_26) 	<m_str>Ms. Helm 's</m_str> (11_12) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_16) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_26) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_11) 	<m_str>Ms. Helm</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>Eva Gisela Schittenhelm</m_str> (13_27) 	<m_str>Ms. Helm , who was 16 when she was tricked into taking a screen test</m_str> (14_29) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_36) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (14_48) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (14_12) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_48) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_7) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_16) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_30) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_39) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>Ms. Helm , who had her own artistic standards</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>you</m_str> (17_7) 	<m_str>you</m_str> (18_7) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (4_36) 	<m_str>Josef von Sternberg</m_str> (4_22) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (9_18) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (13_59) 	<br><blue>7(6)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_11) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_14) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_10) 	<br><blue>8(9)</blue>: <m_str>Fritz Lang 's</m_str> (1_21) 	<m_str>Lang 's</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_24) 	<m_str>Lang</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>Lang 's</m_str> (14_17) 	<m_str>Lang</m_str> (15_19) 	<m_str>Lang</m_str> (16_43) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>Lang</m_str> (19_25) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>The film</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>10(4)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (6_22) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (6_7) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>This</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>the movie</m_str> (9_15) 	<m_str>the movie</m_str> (19_2) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>Georg Wilhelm Pabst 's</m_str> (5_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_37) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>the starring role in `` Blue Angel</m_str> (4_27) 	<m_str>the role</m_str> (5_47) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>her place</m_str> (16_16) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (16_22) 	<br><blue>15(1)</blue>: <m_str>the German film industry</m_str> (3_12) 	<br><blue>16(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (8_46) 	<m_str>slavelike workers</m_str> (8_38) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
