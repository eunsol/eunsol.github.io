<blue>1</blue>Iris Murdoch , a prodigiously inventive and idiosyncratic British writer whose 26 novels offered lively plots , complex characters and intellectual speculation , died yesterday at a nursing home in Oxford , England . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 79 and had Alzheimer 's disease . <br><blue>3</blue>Her struggle with Alzheimer 's was documented recently in '' Elegy for Iris , '' a memoir by her husband , the critic and novelist John Bayley , who was at her bedside when she died . <br><blue>4</blue>Miss Murdoch 's first novel was published in 1954 and in a career that lasted for more than four decades , her fiction received many honors , including the Booker Prize for '' The Sea , the Sea , '' the Whitbread Literary Award for Fiction for '' The Sacred and Profane Love Machine '' and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for '' The Black Prince . '' <br><blue>5</blue>Although she was made a Dame of the British Empire , she rarely garnered the attention given to gaudier contemporaries . <br><blue>6</blue>She spent much of her career quietly teaching and writing , away from lecture tours , prize committees and television appearances . <br><blue>7</blue>Along with novels , she produced a half a dozen works on philosophy , several plays , critical writing on literature and modern ideas and poetry . <br><blue>8</blue>Miss Murdoch had a background in philosophy -- she knew and wrote about Jean-Paul Sartre , studied with Ludwig Wittgenstein and was a lecturer in philosophy at Oxford University -- and her fiction grappled with such questions as the nature of good and evil . <br><blue>9</blue>This led many who knew her work superficially to assume that her novels were philosophical explorations of the origins of morality and behavior and too esoteric or intellectually rigorous for a general audience . <br><blue>10</blue>In fact , many of Miss Murdoch 's novels are exuberantly melodramatic , offering bemused records of romantic or erotic follies , as well as more somber battles between individuals representing moral good and its opposite . <br><blue>11</blue>Her characters , drawn largely from the middle class , are described with loving exactitude and in such depth that their struggles to define what it means to live a good life take on dramatic force . <br><blue>12</blue>In Books , Happiness And Moral Lessons Far from viewing fiction as another and lesser way of dealing with philosophical questions , Miss Murdoch argued that literature was meant '' to be grasped by enjoyment , '' and that the art of the tale was '' a fundamental form of thought '' in its own right . <br><blue>13</blue>The ideal reader , she told one interviewer , was '' someone who likes a jolly good yarn and enjoys thinking about the book as well , about the moral issues . '' <br><blue>14</blue>In another interview she went further , asserting that good art offers '' uncontaminated '' happiness that also teaches '' how to look at the world and to understand it ; it makes everything far more interesting . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Her belief in literature had its inception in her happy and book-filled childhood . <br><blue>16</blue>Jean Iris Murdoch was born in Dublin on July 15 , 1919 , the only child of British and Irish parents . <br><blue>17</blue>When she was a year old her family moved to London , where her father , Wills John Hughes Murdoch , joined the civil service . <br><blue>18</blue>In interviews she remembered that as a child she had existed '' in a perfect trinity of love . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Her mother , the former Irene Alice Richardson , who had trained as an opera singer , was a '' beautiful , lively , witty woman with a happy temperament . '' <br><blue>20</blue>Her father began discussing books with her early on and encouraged her to read widely . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Ludwig Wittgenstein</m_str> (8_19) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>the world</m_str> (14_25) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_30) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_32) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Her belief in literature</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (15_6) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Oxford</m_str> (1_31) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Alzheimer 's</m_str> (3_4) 	<m_str>Alzheimer 's</m_str> (2_6) 	<br><blue>6(35)</blue>: <m_str>Her</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>Jean Iris Murdoch</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_7) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (18_9) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_19) 	<m_str>Miss Murdoch 's</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>the former Irene Alice Richardson</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_32) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (3_35) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_22) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_7) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_12) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>Miss Murdoch</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_6) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_32) 	<m_str>Miss Murdoch 's</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>Miss Murdoch</m_str> (12_23) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_4) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>her father , Wills John Hughes Murdoch</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>Her father</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>a career that lasted for more than four decades</m_str> (4_12) 	<m_str>her career</m_str> (6_5) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>her fiction</m_str> (8_32) 	<m_str>her fiction</m_str> (4_22) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>Miss Murdoch 's novels</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>her novels</m_str> (9_12) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (11_21) 	<m_str>Her characters , drawn largely from the middle class</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (11_26) 	<m_str>loving exactitude</m_str> (11_14) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (12_54) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (10_35) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
