<blue>1</blue>Werenfried van Straaten , a Dutch priest who provided clothes , medicine and food for Germans left destitute by war and who built a Christian charity that is active worldwide today , died on Jan. 31 in a hospital in Bad Soden , Germany . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 90 . <br><blue>3</blue>The death was announced by Aid to the Church in Need at its headquarters in Königstein , near Frankfurt . <br><blue>4</blue>As founder and elder statesman of the organization , he continued to serve it , most recently on a mission to Ukraine last year . <br><blue>5</blue>His charity became a mainstay of Catholic churches and the faithful the war had left behind under Soviet rule . <br><blue>6</blue>Currently it also supports Christians in the third world , on a budget of about $ 80 million yearly from nearly 700,000 donors in Europe and the United States . <br><blue>7</blue>Philip Johannes Hendrik van Straaten was a son of two Dutch teachers , born in Mijdrecht , and raised as a Catholic . <br><blue>8</blue>He studied literature at the University of Utrecht , but felt drawn to the priesthood and in 1934 sought to join the Capuchin Franciscans . <br><blue>9</blue>Failing the medical tests for their rigorous life of poverty , he found his spiritual home at the Norbertine Abbey of Tongerlo , in Belgium . <br><blue>10</blue>There , he was ordained and given the name Werenfried , meaning Warrior for Peace . <br><blue>11</blue>He founded a journal for the order and wrote an article for the Christmas 1947 issue , '' No Room at the Inn , '' that set the course of his life . <br><blue>12</blue>His topic was the 14 million homeless and starving people , mostly Germans , who had fled or were driven from their homes in Central and Eastern Europe to Germany under the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements . <br><blue>13</blue>Father Werenfried 's first appeal was to the people of Flanders but it echoed throughout Belgium and the Netherlands , regions that had recently suffered under German occupation . <br><blue>14</blue>Yet , people responded to his call to forgive the defeated enemy , and ease the plight of refugees . <br><blue>15</blue>Father Werenfried became known as the bacon priest , who scoured the countryside for donations of food and clothing and turned the monastery at Tongerlo into a vast warehouse . '' <br><blue>16</blue>Chapel trucks '' carted the goods that were collected , and to this day the charity 's headquarters , now at Königstein , remains a depot . <br><blue>17</blue>The growing organization received Papal recognition once it turned to providing support for Christians and churches smarting under Soviet domination . <br><blue>18</blue>Father Werenfried traveled throughout the West to raise awareness of this '' Church of Silence , '' along with material help and prayerbooks . <br><blue>19</blue>He also ventured , sometimes clandestinely , into the Soviet sphere to meet with church leaders and judge the situation on the ground . <br><blue>20</blue>He started a newsletter circulated in six languages around the world to document instances of persecution of churches and the faithful . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>the charity 's</m_str> (16_15) 	<m_str>His charity</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>a Christian charity that is active worldwide today</m_str> (1_24) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the medical tests</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (9_6) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_10) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (12_22) 	<m_str>starving people , mostly Germans , who had fled or were driven from their homes in Central and Eastern Europe to Germany under the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements</m_str> (12_9) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>The growing organization</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>the organization</m_str> (4_7) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the war</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (6_2) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Father Werenfried 's first appeal</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (13_13) 	<br><blue>8(5)</blue>: <m_str>Father Werenfried</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>Father Werenfried</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Father Werenfried 's</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>Need</m_str> (3_11) 	<br><blue>10(9)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_14) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_31) 	<m_str>Philip Johannes Hendrik van Straaten</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>Tongerlo</m_str> (15_25) 	<m_str>Tongerlo</m_str> (9_22) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>the third world</m_str> (6_7) 	<m_str>the world</m_str> (20_10) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>Germans</m_str> (1_16) 	<m_str>Germans</m_str> (12_13) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>Eastern Europe</m_str> (12_27) 	<m_str>Europe</m_str> (6_25) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>Germany</m_str> (12_30) 	<m_str>Germany</m_str> (1_44) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
