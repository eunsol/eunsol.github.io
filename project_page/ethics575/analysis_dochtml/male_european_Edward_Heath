<blue>1</blue>Sir Edward Heath , who as prime minister took Britain into the European Economic Community in 1973 and for decades was the Conservative Party 's leading advocate of European unity , died yesterday at his home in Salisbury , his spokesman said . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 89 and had retired from the House of Commons in 2001 , after 51 years in Parliament . <br><blue>3</blue>Britain 's admission to what is now called the European Union was the high point of his time as prime minister , from 1970 to 1974 , and the fulfillment of an ambition frustrated a decade earlier . <br><blue>4</blue>Then , as a junior minister , he negotiated terms for Britain 's entry , only to see it vetoed in 1963 by de Gaulle . <br><blue>5</blue>His commitment to Europe made Sir Edward , who was knighted in 1992 , unpopular with some factions in an island country that has never been entirely sure about its place among the Continentals . <br><blue>6</blue>For decades he was not on speaking terms with his fellow Conservative Margaret Thatcher , who ousted him as the party 's leader in Parliament in 1975 , and was a fierce critic of closer European political unity when she was prime minister , from 1979 to 1990 . <br><blue>7</blue>Baroness Thatcher , as she later became , was the heroine of the party 's so-called Euroskeptic wing , and Sir Edward its chief scapegoat . <br><blue>8</blue>A lifelong bachelor , he brooded in later years in the solitude of Arundells , the magnificent home he bought beside Salisbury Cathedral , sallying forth periodically to joust against Rule Britannia die-hards at party conferences , returning to sulk after enduring jeers . <br><blue>9</blue>When he was asked in 1990 whether it was possible that Mrs. Thatcher might have done a few good things as prime minister , his reaction was as startling as a lightning strike on the cathedral spire across the green . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Name one ! '' <br><blue>11</blue>he roared , in the gravelly bass baritone that was as much a trademark as his bright blue eyes and his thatch of white hair . <br><blue>12</blue>He contended that her hostility to Europe was an important reason she was forced to resign as prime minister in 1990 after a party leadership conference . <br><blue>13</blue>He also held the party 's increasingly anti-European stance responsible for the its overwhelming defeat in the election of 1997 , when the Labor Party under Tony Blair ended an 18-year Conservative winning streak . <br><blue>14</blue>Sir Edward , a trained organist and pianist , was often self-absorbed , seeking consolation in his hobbies , music and sailing . <br><blue>15</blue>As prime minister and later , he fulfilled a youthful ambition and became a conductor , directing the London Symphony Orchestra in Elgar 's '' Cockaigne '' Overture in 1971 , the first of many such concerts with the symphony and other orchestras around the world . <br><blue>16</blue>Did the organ and conducting give him a sense of power ? '' <br><blue>17</blue>' Yes ' is the answer , '' he wrote in '' Music : A Joy for Life '' ( Pavilion Books Ltd. , 1997 ) , '' but not of power over people : it is the power of contributing sound to the general uplift of those making music together . '' <br><blue>18</blue>A Gentleman 's Education Edward Richard George Heath was born during a German air raid on July 9 , 1916 , in St. Peter 's - in-Thanet , a village in Broadstairs , a small coastal resort in Kent , on the southeastern coast , where his working-class family had its roots . <br><blue>19</blue>His father , William George Heath , was a carpenter who eventually ran his own building firm ; his mother , Edith Anne Pantony Heath , worked as a maid before she gave birth to Edward and his younger brother , John , who died in 1983 . <br><blue>20</blue>His parents sent Edward to the local Church of England primary school and made considerable financial sacrifice to buy him an upright piano for lessons . <br><hr><br><blue>1(23)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_35) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_7) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (6_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_40) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>Sir Edward , who was knighted in 1992</m_str> (5_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_17) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>1997</m_str> (13_20) 	<m_str>1997</m_str> (17_25) 	<br><blue>3(7)</blue>: <m_str>the party 's</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>the party 's</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>the Labor Party under Tony Blair</m_str> (13_23) 	<m_str>the Conservative Party 's</m_str> (1_22) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>the party 's</m_str> (6_20) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (7_23) 	<br><blue>4(6)</blue>: <m_str>Sir Edward</m_str> (7_21) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Edward</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>Edward</m_str> (19_36) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (20_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_38) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>his working-class family</m_str> (18_47) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (18_51) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Parliament</m_str> (2_19) 	<m_str>Parliament</m_str> (6_25) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>William George Heath</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>Edward Richard George Heath</m_str> (18_5) 	<br><blue>8(5)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (18_47) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>His father , William George Heath</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_19) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>she</m_str> (19_32) 	<m_str>his mother , Edith Anne Pantony Heath</m_str> (19_19) 	<br><blue>10(6)</blue>: <m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (4_12) 	<m_str>Britain 's entry</m_str> (4_12) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (4_19) 	<m_str>Britain</m_str> (1_10) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (5_30) 	<m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (3_1) 	<br><blue>11(1)</blue>: <m_str>the organ</m_str> (16_2) 	<br><blue>12(6)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>Mrs. Thatcher</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>Baroness Thatcher , as she later became</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_40) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>1990</m_str> (12_21) 	<m_str>1990</m_str> (9_6) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
