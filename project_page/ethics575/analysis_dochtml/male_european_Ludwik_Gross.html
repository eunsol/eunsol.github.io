<blue>1</blue>Dr. Ludwik Gross , who influenced cancer research by showing that viruses could cause cancers in animals , died on Monday at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 94 and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was stomach cancer , said his daughter , Dr. Augusta H. Gross . <br><blue>4</blue>Dr. Gross won an Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation prize in 1974 for his discovery of what became known as the Gross mouse leukemia virus . <br><blue>5</blue>His work in the 1950 's , the Lasker jury said , opened the field of tumor virology in mammals and '' laid the foundations for the subsequent discovery by others of cancer-inducing viruses in animals of various species ranging from rodents to the higher primates . '' <br><blue>6</blue>Until 1951 , scientists believed that mouse leukemia , and many other leukemias , were genetic diseases and not transmissible . <br><blue>7</blue>Then Dr. Gross upset that dogma by showing that a virus caused mouse leukemia and could be passed naturally from generation to generation , mother to baby . <br><blue>8</blue>For many years '' there was considerable reluctance and often even frank hostility to accept '' his findings , he wrote in Cancer Research , a scientific journal , in 1978 . <br><blue>9</blue>For the half-century before Dr. Gross 's discovery , scientists had largely ignored the role of viruses in cancer even though , beginning in 1908 , researchers had suggested a viral cause by transmitting leukemia and sarcomas in chickens . <br><blue>10</blue>Over the next 30 years , scientists transmitted a type of kidney cancer prevalent in frogs in New England lakes to other frogs , and also transmitted breast cancer in mice through milk from mothers to their offspring . <br><blue>11</blue>Scientists called the mysterious factor responsible for transmitting the mouse breast cancer '' milk influence , '' not a virus , and used similarly meaningless terms to explain other transmissions now known to result from viruses . <br><blue>12</blue>In a sense , the ignorance was understandable : laboratory tools for detecting viruses were crude . <br><blue>13</blue>But another problem was attitude . <br><blue>14</blue>For decades , '' investigators hesitated strongly to accept even as a working hypothesis the existence of a transmissible virus as the cause of tumors , '' Dr. Gross wrote in a Cancer Research article in 1985 . <br><blue>15</blue>Dr. Gross attributed that resistance to scientists ' penchant for following certain generally accepted concepts . '' <br><blue>16</blue>Research projects and experimental approaches radically different from such accepted concepts or theories were not only frowned upon , '' he wrote , '' but often resulted in the refusal of the necessary financial and logistical support needed by the investigator to carry out his proposed studies . '' <br><blue>17</blue>Long before his discovery , Dr. Gross had theorized that a virus caused mouse leukemia . <br><blue>18</blue>But for some time his many experiments at the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital , where he was chief of cancer research , failed to find it . <br><blue>19</blue>One day he heard a lecture by a scientist who was working on a different virus and who said he could show its harmful effects by injecting it into suckling mice , though not by injecting it into older mice . <br><blue>20</blue>So Dr. Gross injected material from leukemic mice into newborn mice of a strain known to be free of the leukemia , thus isolating a virus . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>: <m_str>his discovery of what became known as the Gross mouse leukemia virus</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>the subsequent discovery</m_str> (5_27) 	<m_str>Dr. Gross 's discovery</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>his discovery</m_str> (17_3) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>mouse leukemia</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>mouse leukemia</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (18_26) 	<m_str>the leukemia</m_str> (20_20) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Bronx</m_str> (1_27) 	<m_str>the Bronx</m_str> (2_11) 	<br><blue>4(7)</blue>: <m_str>the investigator</m_str> (16_40) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_45) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_20) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>cancer research</m_str> (1_7) 	<m_str>Cancer Research</m_str> (8_23) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (19_37) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (19_23) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (19_28) 	<br><blue>7(14)</blue>: <m_str>Dr. Ludwik Gross , who influenced cancer research by showing that viruses could cause cancers in animals</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_8) 	<m_str>Dr. Gross</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Lasker</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>Dr. Gross</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>Dr. Gross 's</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>Dr. Gross</m_str> (14_28) 	<m_str>Dr. Gross</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_21) 	<m_str>Dr. Gross</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>Dr. Gross</m_str> (20_2) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>a virus</m_str> (7_10) 	<m_str>a virus</m_str> (17_11) 	<m_str>a virus</m_str> (20_25) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (8_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_20) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
