<blue>1</blue>Richard Wollheim , a philosopher who synthesized analytic philosophy , psychoanalysis and the study of painting to develop aesthetic insights that are considered among the most profound of the postwar era , died on Tuesday at his home in London . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 80 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was heart failure , said a statement released by the philosophy department of the University of California at Berkeley ; Professor Wollheim was the department 's chairman from 1998 to 2002 . <br><blue>4</blue>His intellectual dexterity , at times almost playfulness , was suggested by works ranging from a widely respected biography of Freud to a well-received novel to an examination of human emotions that some reviewers saw as the basis for a general theory of a subject largely ignored by philosophers . <br><blue>5</blue>But his greatest impact , also unusual for an analytic philosopher , was on art . <br><blue>6</blue>He coined the term Minimalism in his 1965 essay '' Minimal Art . '' <br><blue>7</blue>It actually referred not to the new artists , soon to be called Minimalists , who were then beginning to emerge , but to monochromatic paintings and Marcel Duchamp 's display of ordinary objects as art . <br><blue>8</blue>A larger and much heralded accomplishment was developing a new approach and vocabulary for experiencing art . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Wollheim , developing the ideas of Wittgenstein and Freud , argued that art could be understood only within its total context , from history to the nature of the surrounding community to the viewers ' and artists ' emotional dispositions and physical and psychic needs . <br><blue>10</blue>His idea was to begin viewing a painted surface in the same way that you might try to find a face in the clouds or in the way that you might , as Leonardo did , visualize landscapes in stains on a wall . <br><blue>11</blue>Then he would try to interpret the artist 's intentions . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Wollheim believed that unlocking the meaning of a painting involved retrieving , or almost re-enacting , the creative activity that produced it . <br><blue>13</blue>He asserted that this was possible because artists and viewers shared a universal human nature . <br><blue>14</blue>In '' Painting as an Art : The A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts '' ( Princeton University Press , 1987 ) , a collection of talks originally delivered at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1984 , he called such a communion '' seeing in . '' <br><blue>15</blue>His personal method of '' seeing in '' became famously idiosyncratic . <br><blue>16</blue>He said in the lectures : '' I evolved a way of looking at paintings which was massively time-consuming and deeply rewarding . <br><blue>17</blue>For I came to recognize that it often took the first hour or so in front of a painting for stray associations or motivated misperceptions to settle down , and it was only then , with the same amount of time or more spent looking at it , that the picture could be relied upon to disclose itself as it was . '' <br><blue>18</blue>I noticed that I became an object of suspicion to passers-by , and so did the picture that I was looking at . '' <br><blue>19</blue>All that looking , however , seemed to bring rewards . <br><blue>20</blue>Many reviewers remarked on the insightfulness of the book 's final chapter , in which Mr. Wollheim contends that certain paintings by Titian , Bellini , Willem de Kooning and others represent the painter 's attempt to project his fantasies about the human body onto his canvas . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the artist 's intentions</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>this</m_str> (13_4) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (1_40) 	<br><blue>3(5)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_19) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_4) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>art</m_str> (9_14) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (9_20) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (20_46) 	<m_str>the painter 's</m_str> (20_33) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_39) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>a widely respected biography of Freud</m_str> (4_16) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>the book 's</m_str> (20_8) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the picture</m_str> (17_50) 	<m_str>the picture</m_str> (18_16) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>the philosophy department of the University of California</m_str> (3_12) 	<m_str>the department 's</m_str> (3_26) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>you</m_str> (10_30) 	<m_str>you</m_str> (10_15) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>the term Minimalism</m_str> (6_3) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>Leonardo</m_str> (10_34) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_2) 	<br><blue>13(14)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_37) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Professor Wollheim</m_str> (3_23) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Wollheim</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Wollheim</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_43) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Wollheim</m_str> (20_16) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>the artist 's</m_str> (11_7) 	<br><blue>15(1)</blue>: <m_str>the University of California</m_str> (3_16) 	<br><blue>16(5)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (17_31) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (17_47) 	<m_str>a painting for stray associations or motivated misperceptions to settle down</m_str> (17_18) 	<m_str>itself</m_str> (17_58) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (17_60) 	<br><blue>17(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (12_23) 	<m_str>a painting involved retrieving , or almost re-enacting</m_str> (12_9) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
