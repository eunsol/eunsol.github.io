<blue>1</blue>Benny Andrews , a figural expressionistic painter and teacher whose paintings , prints , drawings and collages drew on his African-American roots in Georgia , died on Friday at his home in Brooklyn . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 75 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , said Nene Humphrey , his wife . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Andrews was a vivid storyteller , using memories of his childhood in the segregated South to create narrative-based works that addressed human suffering and injustice . <br><blue>5</blue>Over his lifetime , his social concerns ranged from the civil rights struggle and the antiwar movement to the Holocaust , poverty and the forced relocation of American Indians . <br><blue>6</blue>His paintings and drawings do not fit easily into one art historical tradition . <br><blue>7</blue>They sometimes resemble the anti-Modernist American Scene paintings , though with a lyrical , almost decorative stylization that draws upon Surrealism and Southern folk art . <br><blue>8</blue>Some works border on caricature , but the formal narrative quality of his images also suggest his identification with Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence . <br><blue>9</blue>Even in an era dominated by abstract art , he continuously exhibited his work in galleries and was the recipient of numerous awards and prizes , including a John Hay Whitney Fellowship in 1965 and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in 1974 . <br><blue>10</blue>His paintings , prints and collages are in the collections of more than 30 museums , including those of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Museum of Modern Art , the Studio Museum in Harlem , the High Museum of Art in Atlanta and the Art Institute of Chicago . <br><blue>11</blue>The Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans holds a major body of his work , and his archives of material about black artists in the 1960s and '70s was given to the Studio Museum . <br><blue>12</blue>Benny Andrews was born in Plainview , a farming community three miles from Madison , Ga. , on Nov. 13 , 1930 , the son of sharecroppers . <br><blue>13</blue>He was one of 10 children , who all worked in the cotton fields to help support the family , attending school only sporadically . <br><blue>14</blue>In 1948 he became the first member of his family to graduate from high school . <br><blue>15</blue>From 1950 to 1953 , he served in the United States Air Force , and used the G.I. Bill to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago . <br><blue>16</blue>He was one of very few black students there . <br><blue>17</blue>He was trained as an abstract expressionist , but at night went to jazz clubs to draw . <br><blue>18</blue>He also earned fees illustrating Polish polka record covers . <br><blue>19</blue>In 1958 , Mr. Andrews moved to New York , where his friends included the artists Red Grooms , Bob Thompson , Lester Johnson , Mimi Gross and Raphael Soyer . <br><blue>20</blue>His first New York solo exhibition , at Forum Gallery in 1962 , was reviewed favorably in The New York Times . <br><hr><br><blue>1(28)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Andrews</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Andrews</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_19) 	<m_str>Benny Andrews</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_30) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_9) 	<m_str>Nene Humphrey , his wife</m_str> (3_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_10) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>His paintings and drawings</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (7_1) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>his work</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>his work</m_str> (11_15) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>His first New York solo exhibition , at Forum Gallery in 1962</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Art Institute of Chicago</m_str> (10_46) 	<m_str>the Art Institute of Chicago</m_str> (15_25) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the artists</m_str> (19_15) 	<m_str>black artists in the 1960s and '70s</m_str> (11_24) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the family</m_str> (13_18) 	<m_str>his family to graduate from high school</m_str> (14_9) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
