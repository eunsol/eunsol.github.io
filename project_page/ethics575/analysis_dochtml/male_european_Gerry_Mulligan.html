<blue>1</blue>Gerry Mulligan , a baritone saxophonist and a major figure in jazz , died on Saturday morning at his home in Darien , Conn. from complications after surgery for a knee infection , said his wife , Franca . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 68 . <br><blue>3</blue>He had been suffering from liver cancer , said George Wein , the director of the JVC Jazz Festival and a close personal friend . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Mulligan was one of the great improvisers of postwar jazz . <br><blue>5</blue>In his hands the baritone saxophone , usually a burly , stiff creature , became supple and elegant . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. Mulligan was after grace and gentleness when he improvised , and his solos , whether at a ballad tempo or at faster speed , always have warmth to them that makes them seem personal . <br><blue>7</blue>Wit played a large part in his improvisations , and in many of his solos , he added riffs that sparkled , an odd quote or a sly melodic fillip that took his creations out of the realm of the ordinary . <br><blue>8</blue>His solos had flow , logic , tempo , and sense of progression . <br><blue>9</blue>Though Mr. Mulligan was a special improviser , much of his importance came from his conception as a band leader and arranger ; for much of his early career , he was hailed more as a songwriter than as an soloist . <br><blue>10</blue>In 1952 with the trumpeter Chet Baker , Mr. Mulligan settled on the instrumentation for a group that included simply the two of them , a bassist and a drummer , leaving out the pianist . <br><blue>11</blue>That group , which came together in Los Angeles , helped solidify California as the home territory for what was called the Cool School of jazz . <br><blue>12</blue>And it identified Mr. Mulligan , who ironically spent most of his time on the East Coast , as a leader of the movement . <br><blue>13</blue>Over the years , Mr. Mulligan developed a writing personality that can be traced to one of his most important early successes , the music he produced for the Miles Davis " Birth of the Cool " nonet . <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Mulligan 's subsequent composing , whether for small groups or large , studiously avoided the cliches of big band orchestration , opting instead for a well-centered , calmly rational approach . <br><blue>15</blue>And he made sure that many of his arrangements were full of moving lines , not only referring to an earlier style of polyphonic jazz , but also making his arrangements sound almost improvised . <br><blue>16</blue>The pianist John Lewis said Mr. Mulligan 's influence had " become so general , they wo n't know to give him credit in the next generation . " <br><blue>17</blue>Gerald Joseph Mulligan was born in New York on April 6 , 1927 , and grew up in Philadelphia . <br><blue>18</blue>He began his professional career at age 17 , working with a series of East Coast bands , including the groups of Johnny Warrington , George Paxton and Tommy Tucker , for whom he was playing alto saxophone and arranging . <br><blue>19</blue>In 1946 , Mr. Mulligan returned to New York City and began a series of higher-profile jobs , including arranging for Gene Krupa , for whom he contributed " Disc Jockey Jump , " an early Mulligan classic , and Claude Thornhill , a progressive big-band leader . <br><blue>20</blue>It was with Thornhill 's band that Mr. Mulligan met the arranger Gil Evans , who introduced him to an especially fertile scene of young , creative musicians who were about to change the sound of jazz , including Miles Davis , the composer George Russell and Mr. Lewis , who went on to found the Modern Jazz Quartet . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>the pianist</m_str> (10_34) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>East Coast</m_str> (18_15) 	<m_str>the East Coast</m_str> (12_15) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>his wife , Franca</m_str> (1_35) 	<br><blue>4(43)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>The pianist John Lewis</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan 's</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_30) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>Gerald Joseph Mulligan</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_22) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>Franca</m_str> (1_38) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_34) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan</m_str> (20_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_27) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (20_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Lewis</m_str> (20_48) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_17) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_33) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_27) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_31) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan , who ironically spent most of his time on the East Coast , as a leader of the movement</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Mulligan 's</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_26) 	<m_str>the Miles Davis</m_str> (13_29) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Thornhill 's</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>Claude Thornhill , a progressive big-band leader</m_str> (19_41) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (11_8) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (6_30) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (6_33) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>his professional career</m_str> (18_3) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>his solos</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>his solos</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>His solos</m_str> (8_1) 	<br><blue>10(3)</blue>: <m_str>a group that included simply the two of them , a bassist and a drummer , leaving out the pianist</m_str> (10_16) 	<m_str>That group , which came together in Los Angeles</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (12_2) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>his arrangements</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>his arrangements</m_str> (15_30) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
