<blue>1</blue>Bishop Francis J. Mugavero , who in his 22 years as the head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn combined staunch liberalism and a fierce loyalty to the Vatican , died yesterday at the age of 77 . <br><blue>2</blue>The Bishop , who retired in February 1990 , died of a heart attack while vacationing in East Hampton , L.I. , said Frank DeRosa , the spokesman for the Brooklyn Diocese . <br><blue>3</blue>Bishop Mugavero ( pronounced Ma-GUV-a-ro ) was the first native of Brooklyn to lead the diocese , which covers 1.6 million Catholics in Brooklyn and Queens . <br><blue>4</blue>The diocese is independent of the Archdiocese of New York , which encompasses the three other boroughs , Westchester and six other counties north of the city . <br><blue>5</blue>Tall and bald -- he often joked with youngsters that he was Kojak -- the Bishop gained a reputation as a liberal because of his emphasis on social concerns over issues of doctrine . <br><blue>6</blue>He was a prime mover behind the Nehemiah Housing Project , which builds private homes for the poor in Brooklyn , and was a founder of the Campaign for Human Development , a national church collection that has raised millions of dollars for the poor . <br><blue>7</blue>Drew Ire of Conservatives The " marriage tribunal " that he established to grant annulments to divorced Catholics was among the most active in the nation and drew the ire of some conservatives . <br><blue>8</blue>Bishop Mugavero always maintained that it operated within the strict interpretation of church law . <br><blue>9</blue>Unlike some of the 300 other Roman Catholic bishops in the nation , however , Bishop Mugavero had a background not in canon law but in charity work . <br><blue>10</blue>He headed Brooklyn 's office of Catholic Charities before being appointed a bishop in 1968 . <br><blue>11</blue>Eugene Kennedy of Loyola University , an author of several books on the Catholic heirarchy , said that Bishop Mugavero 's background in charities shaped his career as a bishop . <br><blue>12</blue>" His understanding of the human condition was different than that of his brother bishops trained in canon law , " Mr. Kennedy said . <br><blue>13</blue>He did not see everything in terms of legalities , Mr. Kennedy added , " which made him a very pastoral bishop . " <br><blue>14</blue>Still , Bishop Mugavero never confronted the Vatican , as some other liberal prelates did . <br><blue>15</blue>Obeyed Vatican on Gay Group For example , the Bishop allowed Dignity , an organization of Catholic homosexuals , to use church buildings until 1987 , when he was informed by the Vatican that his action appeared to encourage the group . <br><blue>16</blue>He immediately barred Dignity from his churches . <br><blue>17</blue>His ruling disappointed liberals who thought that his first loyalty was to their principles . <br><blue>18</blue>After the Dignity ban , the faculty of Brooklyn College voted to reverse a decision of the school to give Bishop Mugavero an honorary degree . <br><blue>19</blue>In reaction , former Mayor Edward I. Koch made a point that year to give the Bishop the city 's highest honor , the La Guardia Medal . <br><blue>20</blue>In line with Vatican policy , Bishop Mugavero issued more than 20 pastoral letters strongly condemning abortion . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the diocese , which covers 1.6 million Catholics in Brooklyn and Queens</m_str> (3_15) 	<m_str>The diocese</m_str> (4_1) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>a background</m_str> (9_19) 	<m_str>Bishop Mugavero 's background in charities</m_str> (11_19) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>Westchester</m_str> (4_19) 	<m_str>the city</m_str> (4_26) 	<m_str>the city 's</m_str> (19_18) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Gay Group</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>the group</m_str> (15_40) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Catholic Charities</m_str> (10_7) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>Queens</m_str> (3_26) 	<br><blue>7(9)</blue>: <m_str>the Bishop</m_str> (5_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_35) 	<m_str>the Bishop</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_28) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>the Bishop</m_str> (19_16) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>a fierce loyalty</m_str> (1_25) 	<m_str>his first loyalty</m_str> (17_8) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Kennedy</m_str> (12_22) 	<m_str>Mr. Kennedy</m_str> (13_11) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn</m_str> (1_15) 	<m_str>the Brooklyn Diocese</m_str> (2_30) 	<br><blue>11(4)</blue>: <m_str>Brooklyn</m_str> (1_20) 	<m_str>Brooklyn</m_str> (3_12) 	<m_str>Brooklyn</m_str> (6_20) 	<m_str>Brooklyn 's</m_str> (10_3) 	<br><blue>12(1)</blue>: <m_str>a very pastoral bishop</m_str> (13_19) 	<br><blue>13(17)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_25) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>Bishop Mugavero</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Bishop Mugavero</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Bishop Mugavero 's</m_str> (11_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_26) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (13_18) 	<m_str>Mugavero</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>Bishop Mugavero</m_str> (18_21) 	<m_str>Bishop Mugavero</m_str> (20_7) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>Catholic</m_str> (11_14) 	<m_str>Catholic</m_str> (15_17) 	<br><blue>15(5)</blue>: <m_str>the nation</m_str> (7_25) 	<m_str>the nation</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>the Vatican</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>the Vatican</m_str> (15_32) 	<m_str>Vatican</m_str> (20_4) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
