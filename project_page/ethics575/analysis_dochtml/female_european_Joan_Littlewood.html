<blue>1</blue>Joan Littlewood , the producer , director and author who was one of the most important and original figures responsible for the regeneration of the British theater in the 1950 's and 60 's , died Friday in London at the home of her assistant . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 87 . <br><blue>3</blue>Ms. Littlewood 's Theater Workshop , based in a shabby old playhouse in a poor section of East London , won an international reputation with seasons of offbeat work that she staged by herself . <br><blue>4</blue>These included '' Oh What a Lovely War , '' a vaudeville-style re-creation of key events in the First World War ; '' The Quare Fellow '' and '' The Hostage , '' two plays by her protégé , the Irish dramatist Brendan Behan ; and '' A Taste of Honey , '' a bleak portrait of life in Northern England by the 18-year-old Shelagh Delaney . <br><blue>5</blue>As early as 1956 the critic Harold Hobson could declare that Theater Workshop was known throughout Europe as '' England 's premier company . '' <br><blue>6</blue>As much as the kitchen-sink drama of John Osborne and others , which started to appear the same year , Joan Littlewood was responsible for what she called '' the destruction of complacent , well-behaved middle-class theater . '' <br><blue>7</blue>She demonstrated to the British that lively work could be produced on a shoestring , that tight-knit ensembles were likely to produce better work than ad hoc casts , and that performers and dramatists did not need to suppress their working-class identities in order to succeed . '' <br><blue>8</blue>Theater should be grand , vulgar , simple , pathetic , '' Ms. Littlewood said , but '' not genteel , not poetical . '' <br><blue>9</blue>It was her exuberant energy and feisty informality that once provoked Laurence Olivier to remark ruefully : '' I wish I could work that way . <br><blue>10</blue>But I 'm a trained parrot . '' <br><blue>11</blue>Joan Maud Littlewood was born in London in 1914 , the daughter of a 16-year-old unmarried housemaid . <br><blue>12</blue>School trips to the Old Vic , and in particular to John Gielgud 's performance as Hamlet , bred in her a love of the theater and she won a coveted scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art . <br><blue>13</blue>But she was very much the Cockney outsider in a school she later described as being full of '' debs and rich Americans acquiring English accents . '' <br><blue>14</blue>She dropped out and made her way , mostly on foot , to the northern city of Manchester , where she got a job in a local repertory theater . <br><blue>15</blue>She quickly decided , however , that '' curtain theater '' was not for her . <br><blue>16</blue>An instinctive radicalism , combined with habitual restlessness , impelled her toward theater work in which , as she later wrote , everything was created by the actors on a bare platform : '' tempest , sun and rain , rivers , storm-tossed seas . '' <br><blue>17</blue>With Jimmy Miller , who wrote plays under the name of Ewan McColl and was to become her husband , she formed an agitprop group in Manchester called Theater of Action and then created a company called Theater Union , which introduced the British to the American concept called the Living Newspaper , improvisations based on the day 's news . <br><blue>18</blue>After the war this evolved into Theater Workshop , which toured with plays of social or political significance both in Britain and on the Continent . <br><blue>19</blue>The company 's reputation grew , but its finances remained shaky , provoking George Bernard Shaw to tell Ms. Littlewood that her company '' should all go and be stockbrokers -- the English do n't want art . '' <br><blue>20</blue>The actors paid for one tour by picking tomatoes in the country and selling them at a profit in Manchester . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>performers and dramatists</m_str> (7_32) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (7_40) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Theater</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (9_1) 	<br><blue>3(5)</blue>: <m_str>The company 's</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>this</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>her company</m_str> (19_22) 	<m_str>the day 's</m_str> (17_57) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (19_8) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>East London</m_str> (3_18) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (1_39) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (9_19) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (9_21) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (20_15) 	<m_str>The actors</m_str> (20_1) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the theater</m_str> (12_25) 	<m_str>complacent , well-behaved middle-class theater</m_str> (6_33) 	<br><blue>8(28)</blue>: <m_str>She</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (6_27) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_21) 	<m_str>the 18-year-old Shelagh Delaney</m_str> (4_63) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_15) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (3_31) 	<m_str>herself</m_str> (3_34) 	<m_str>Ms. Littlewood</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>Ms. Littlewood</m_str> (19_19) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_22) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_11) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_21) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_28) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_37) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_18) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>Ms. Littlewood 's</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (17_21) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Joan Littlewood</m_str> (6_21) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_44) 	<m_str>Joan Maud Littlewood</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Manchester</m_str> (20_20) 	<m_str>Manchester</m_str> (17_27) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>The Hostage</m_str> (4_30) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>the country</m_str> (20_11) 	<m_str>Britain</m_str> (18_21) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
