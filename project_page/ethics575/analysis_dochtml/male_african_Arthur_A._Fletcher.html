<blue>1</blue>Arthur A. Fletcher , a Republican civil rights advocate whose plan in the 1960 's requiring the government to enforce timetables and goals in the hiring of minority workers became the framework for affirmative action , died Tuesday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington , D.C . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 80 . <br><blue>3</blue>His son , Paul Fletcher , confirmed the death . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Fletcher , who was an adviser to Presidents Richard M. Nixon , Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan , headed the United States Commission on Civil Rights from 1990 to 1993 , under President George Bush . <br><blue>5</blue>In Kansas in the 1950 's , at a time when most black civil rights leaders were Democrats , Mr. Fletcher , the son of a career military man and the son-in-law of a entrepreneur , seemed perfectly at ease pushing for better opportunities for blacks by instituting policies for Republican administrations . <br><blue>6</blue>Yet his political leanings left other black leaders uneasy , while some white Republicans questioned his support of hiring quotas . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Fletcher favored taking race into account to remedy discrimination as a practical matter , despite its loftier ideal of leveling the playing ground . '' <br><blue>8</blue>It 's not about social justice , '' Mr. Fletcher said at a church assembly in Peoria in 2001 , according to The Peoria Journal Star . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Social justice is nice , but I 've got something in my pocket that can buy all the social justice I need . '' <br><blue>10</blue>A college football star who studied under the G.I. Bill of Rights at Washburn University in Topeka , Kan. , Mr. Fletcher was tapped soon after graduating to manage the campaign of Fred Hall , a liberal Republican running for governor , among black voters . <br><blue>11</blue>Mr. Hall won , and Mr. Fletcher was rewarded with a job overseeing the building and maintenance of Kansas highways . <br><blue>12</blue>The job , in the 1950 's in the middle of a boom in highway building , gave him a firsthand look at how lucrative government contracts were handed out , and Mr. Fletcher took from it a belief that better access to those contracts was a cornerstone for improving the prospects of minorities , his son said . <br><blue>13</blue>A staunch defender of education , Mr. Fletcher personally helped finance the lawsuit against the Topeka Board of Education in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case , which successfully sought to desegregate the Topeka schools . <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Fletcher left Kansas after some white business leaders were critical of his efforts to steer contracts to minorities , his son said , and he moved his family to the West Coast . <br><blue>15</blue>After rocks were thrown into the family 's house in a white neighborhood in Sacramento , Calif. , they moved to Berkeley ; eventually , they settled in Washington State . <br><blue>16</blue>There , Mr. Fletcher organized a community self-help program in East Pasco , catching the eye of President Nixon , who appointed Mr. Fletcher his assistant secretary of labor , launching his career on the national stage . <br><blue>17</blue>It was while at the Department of Labor that Mr. Fletcher implemented what became known as the revised Philadelphia Plan , a program to enforce the hiring of minorities by businesses and trade unions contracted by the government . <br><blue>18</blue>Largely successful , it was later amended to include women . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Fletcher resigned from the Nixon administration in December 1971 to become the executive director of the United Negro College Fund , but stepped down a little over a year later after being at odds with the leaders of the 40 predominantly black schools in the fund , whose trust he had failed to gain as a Republican . <br><blue>20</blue>But he was lauded for starting a management training program in the fund and beginning a grass-roots effort to include blacks beyond the middle class . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the fund</m_str> (20_12) 	<m_str>the fund , whose trust he had failed to gain as a Republican</m_str> (19_46) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (7_17) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (8_1) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>Peoria</m_str> (8_17) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Washington State</m_str> (15_29) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (9_7) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (9_21) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Topeka</m_str> (13_36) 	<m_str>Topeka</m_str> (10_17) 	<br><blue>7(28)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (14_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_56) 	<m_str>his son</m_str> (14_21) 	<m_str>his son</m_str> (12_56) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_26) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_28) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (16_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_25) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (17_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_32) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>His son , Paul Fletcher</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Topeka , Kan. , Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (10_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (11_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (12_33) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_51) 	<m_str>Mr. Fletcher</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_13) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the family 's</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>his family</m_str> (14_28) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (15_19) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (15_26) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>a job overseeing the building and maintenance of Kansas highways</m_str> (11_11) 	<m_str>The job</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>11(1)</blue>: <m_str>Kan.</m_str> (10_19) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (12_37) 	<m_str>a firsthand look at how lucrative government contracts were handed out</m_str> (12_20) 	<br><blue>13(3)</blue>: <m_str>the government to enforce timetables and goals in the hiring of minority workers</m_str> (1_17) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>the government</m_str> (17_37) 	<br><blue>14(1)</blue>: <m_str>Washington</m_str> (1_45) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>President Nixon , who appointed Mr. Fletcher his assistant secretary of labor , launching his career on the national stage</m_str> (16_18) 	<m_str>Nixon</m_str> (19_6) 	<br><blue>16(2)</blue>: <m_str>Brown v.
