<blue>1</blue>Patrick Caulfield , a British painter of spare , bright still lifes and interiors whose canny blending of realist styles was most often associated with Pop Art , died on Thursday in London . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 69 . <br><blue>3</blue>His death was confirmed by the Waddington Galleries , which had represented the artist for more than 30 years . <br><blue>4</blue>Born in 1936 , Mr. Caulfield intended originally to become a commercial artist , but he switched to painting while studying at the Chelsea School of Art in the late 1950 's . <br><blue>5</blue>He continued his studies at the Royal College of Art , where other students included the painters David Hockney and R.B. Kitaj and the sculptor Allen Jones ; like them , he was interested in tempering fine art with a commercial coolness . <br><blue>6</blue>The three became prominent members of Britain 's '' New Generation '' of Pop and abstract artists , which also included Anthony Caro , Bridget Riley , Philip King and Howard Hodgkin and was named after a landmark exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1965 . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Caulfield had his first gallery exhibition at the Robert Fraser Gallery in London that year and his first show in New York at the Robert Elkon Gallery in 1966 . <br><blue>8</blue>His work has been the subject of several retrospectives , including ones at the Hayward Gallery in London and the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven in 1999 . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Caulfield rarely depicted the figure , preferring to focus instead on objects and places that implied the human presence , just offstage . <br><blue>10</blue>Using black outlines and saturated colors , he coaxed out the geometric scaffolding beneath perceived reality , often displaying a wry wit . <br><blue>11</blue>Early subjects included a loudspeaker , a lampshade and nearly abstract grids of windowpanes , as well as empty bars and cafes . <br><blue>12</blue>His sense of artifice suggested the formal influence of Mondrian , Stuart Davis and Ben Nicholson , but his main allegiance was to the still life tradition of Braque and Picasso . <br><blue>13</blue>Much of his work has an underlying melancholy , as suggested by his 1968 painting '' Guitar and Rug '' in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington . <br><blue>14</blue>Its nearly solid blue ground and outlined guitar , rolled-up rug and empty wine bottle offer a modern update on Blue Period Picasso . <br><blue>15</blue>In the late 1960 's , Mr. Caulfield began a long involvement with printmaking . <br><blue>16</blue>He would later design book covers , posters and sets for ballets by Frederick Ashton and Michael Corder . <br><blue>17</blue>In the 1980 's , his work became more complicated , introducing elements of Photorealism and trompe l'oeil and more active contrasts of light and shade . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Caulfield 's first marriage , to Pauline Jacobs , ended in divorce . <br><blue>19</blue>He is survived by his wife , Janet Nathan , also an artist , and three sons from his first marriage . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Picasso</m_str> (12_31) 	<m_str>Blue Period Picasso</m_str> (14_21) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>the Hayward Gallery in London</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (8_18) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Caulfield 's first marriage , to Pauline Jacobs</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his first marriage</m_str> (19_19) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>His work</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his work</m_str> (13_3) 	<br><blue>5(26)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>the artist for more than 30 years</m_str> (3_13) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Caulfield</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_3) 	<m_str>R.B.
