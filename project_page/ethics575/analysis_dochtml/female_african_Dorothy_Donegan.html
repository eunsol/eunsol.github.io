<blue>1</blue>Dorothy Donegan , a jazz pianist who brashly mixed swing , boogie-woogie , vaudeville , pop , ragtime and Bach -- sometimes within a span of 10 minutes -- and who was known for an outrageous sense of humor , died on Tuesday at her home in Los Angeles . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 76 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was colon cancer , said The Associated Press . <br><blue>4</blue>Ms. Donegan was better known as a performer than as a recording artist , and her flamboyance helped her find work in a field that was largely hostile to women . <br><blue>5</blue>To a certain extent , it was also her downfall ; her concerts were often criticized for having an excess of personality . <br><blue>6</blue>She would act out songs , mocking their words ; do devastating parodies of pianists and singers , especially if they were in the audience , or get up and shake her hips while keeping up a left-handed riff . <br><blue>7</blue>She could push humor into brazenness and kept up a supply of off-color jokes . <br><blue>8</blue>She told writers without hesitation that sexism caused her obscurity -- that , and her insistence on being paid at the same scale as her male colleagues . <br><blue>9</blue>Born in Chicago , Ms. Donegan was encouraged from an early age by her mother to become a professional musician . <br><blue>10</blue>She was a church organist as a girl , and at 14 she was playing for a dollar a night at the city 's South Side bars . <br><blue>11</blue>She was one of many notable jazz musicians inestimably helped by the tutelage of Walter Dyett , a music teacher at DuSable High School , whose other students included Dinah Washington , Johnny Griffin , Gene Ammons and Von Freeman . <br><blue>12</blue>She played blues and boogie-woogie piano , even recording for the Bluebird label in 1942 , but she aspired to be a classical concert pianist . <br><blue>13</blue>She studied at the Chicago Conservatory and at the Chicago Musical College . <br><blue>14</blue>In 1943 , when she was 18 , she gave a concert at Orchestra Hall in Chicago , the first black performer to do so . <br><blue>15</blue>Time magazine covered the concert , and word about a pianist with a wide repertory and blizzard-fast fingers reached the jazz piano virtuoso Art Tatum , who came to her house to hear her play . <br><blue>16</blue>Tatum showed her some of his technique , and remained the strongest influence on her playing . <br><blue>17</blue>Hollywood soon came calling . <br><blue>18</blue>Persuaded by her agent to turn down a five-year contract from MGM , she accepted a $ 3,000-a-week contract from United Artists for one picture , '' Sensations of 1945 . '' <br><blue>19</blue>She appears in a duet scene with another pianist , Gene Rodgers , and the band behind them was Cab Calloway 's . <br><blue>20</blue>That was the end of her film career . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Los Angeles</m_str> (1_48) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>Chicago</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>Chicago</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>the Chicago</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>Chicago</m_str> (14_17) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (19_18) 	<m_str>another pianist , Gene Rodgers</m_str> (19_8) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (6_21) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (6_8) 	<br><blue>5(32)</blue>: <m_str>her</m_str> (1_45) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Donegan</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_19) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_32) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_15) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_25) 	<m_str>Ms. Donegan</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_14) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_13) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_18) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_9) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_30) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_34) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_15) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (18_14) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>virtuoso Art Tatum , who came to her house to hear her play</m_str> (15_23) 	<m_str>Tatum</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_6) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
