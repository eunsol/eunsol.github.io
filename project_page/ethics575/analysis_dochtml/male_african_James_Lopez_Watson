<blue>1</blue>Judge James Lopez Watson , one of the most senior black members of the federal judiciary , died Saturday at his home in Harlem . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 79 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , his family said . <br><blue>4</blue>At his death , he was a senior judge on the United States Court of International Trade , having been appointed in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to what was then the United States Customs Court . <br><blue>5</blue>In 1980 , Congress reorganized the court , which deals primarily with matters like the classification and valuation of imported goods , tariffs , customs duties and charges of unfair practices by trading partners . <br><blue>6</blue>As the need arose , its nine members could be assigned to sit in any Federal District Court in the nation . <br><blue>7</blue>As a result , Judge Watson , a former New York State senator and city Civil Court judge , worked in districts around the country , presiding over various civil and criminal matters . <br><blue>8</blue>When he was new to the federal bench , in January 1966 , he heard and decided Customs Court cases in California , Oregon and Washington . <br><blue>9</blue>The next month , he was in Atlanta , Tampa , Houston , El Paso , San Antonio and Dallas . <br><blue>10</blue>Other black judges had sat on the Customs Court , but he was the first to be given assignments in the South . <br><blue>11</blue>Legal researchers say that while some black judges had presided over local courts there during the Reconstruction Era after the Civil War , none before him had headed a federal court in the Deep South . <br><blue>12</blue>Born in Harlem , Judge Watson was active in public affairs virtually his entire adult life . <br><blue>13</blue>He first worked for his father , James S. Watson , who presided as a Municipal Court justice for 18 years and then was president of the Municipal Civil Service Commission for four years . <br><blue>14</blue>The son served with the Buffalo Soldiers of World War II in the all-black 371st Infantry Regiment , 92nd Division . <br><blue>15</blue>He was wounded in Italy and came back with a Purple Heart and the Infantry Combat Badge . <br><blue>16</blue>He graduated from New York University in 1947 and from Brooklyn Law School in 1951 . <br><blue>17</blue>He went into private practice and increasingly engaged in politics , winning election to the State Senate in 1954 and to the Civil Court in 1963 . <br><blue>18</blue>He first met Lyndon Johnson , then the Senate majority leader , in 1959 . <br><blue>19</blue>Both his parents had been born in Jamaica , and in 1962 President John F. Kennedy chose him to accompany Vice President Johnson to the Jamaican Independence celebration . <br><blue>20</blue>As a federal judge , he helped modernize his court under the Customs Court Act of 1970 , which brought it more in line with the rest of the federal judiciary system . <br><hr><br><blue>1(11)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (11_26) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>his family</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_5) 	<br><blue>2(14)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>James S.
