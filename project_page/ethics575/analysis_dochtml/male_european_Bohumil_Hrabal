         <h1>Bohumil Hrabal, 82, Who Defied Censors in Wry Tales of Ordinary Czechs </h1>

 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>Bohumil Hrabal , who was widely regarded as the grand old man of Czech literature and whose novella '' Closely Watched Trains '' became an Oscar-winning film , died on Monday in a fall from a Prague hospital building . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 82 . <br><blue>3</blue>A hospital spokesman said he was being treated for severe arthritis at the hospital and fell from a fifth-floor window as he tried to feed birds , Reuters reported . <br><blue>4</blue>His hallmark was tragedy tinged with humor , and he wrote of the travails of ordinary people as well as the intelligentsia from a mildly surreal perspective . <br><blue>5</blue>He was in love with the Czechs and their language and imparted this love in novels , short stories , poems , film scripts , essays and autobiographical ruminations . <br><blue>6</blue>The caprices of a Czech existence kept him from becoming a professional writer until 1962 , when he was 48 , but then his contributions poured forth in a steady stream the state censors sought vainly to dam . <br><blue>7</blue>He welcomed the Prague Spring of Alexander Dubcek in 1968 , and when the Soviet-led invasion snuffed out the democracy movement he fed a devoted readership by samizdat , or clandestine publication , and with copies smuggled from abroad . <br><blue>8</blue>He was one of the few well-known Czech writers who neither fled the country nor bowed to the quasi-Stalinist conformity that descended with the Soviet tanks . <br><blue>9</blue>Refusing to provide the obligatory '' self-criticism , '' he was banished to oblivion . <br><blue>10</blue>He resurfaced in 1976 with '' The Haircut , '' causing a sensation and much political prognostication about a reawakening of Czech literary life . <br><blue>11</blue>The 20,000 copies allowed by the Government flew from the shelves before the day was out . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Hrabal 's '' Too Loud a Solitude '' ( 1990 ) , told the tale of Hanta , a somewhat reclusive career flunky . <br><blue>13</blue>Hanta earned his keep by crushing and baling printed matter like books for recycling , echoing a chapter in the author 's own past . <br><blue>14</blue>In '' Dancing Lessons for an Advanced Age '' ( 1995 ) , he tells of a life lived to the full -- all in a single rambling sentence . <br><blue>15</blue>He recalls his bawdy exploits as a soldier , brewery worker and cobbler , remembrances falling like cards from a well-shuffled deck . '' <br><blue>16</blue>Closely Watched Trains , '' one of his early efforts and a runaway success , was a deftly humorous story of a very young man heroically facing the country 's Nazi occupiers in 1945 . <br><blue>17</blue>He and Jiri Menzel , an actor and director , turned the book into a movie that won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film of 1967 . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Hrabal , son of a brewery agent , was born in 1914 in the Moravian city of Brno in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire . <br><blue>19</blue>Travels with his father exposed him to the foibles and concerns of common folk . <br><blue>20</blue>He studied law at Charles University in Prague until it was shut down during the German occupation . <br><hr><br><blue>1(11)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (19_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_14) 	<m_str>Hanta</m_str> (12_18) 	<m_str>Hanta</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>2(16)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_10) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_22) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_22) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_10) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (6_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>the grand old man of Czech literature</m_str> (1_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_24) 	<m_str>Alexander Dubcek</m_str> (7_7) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the country</m_str> (8_13) 	<m_str>the country 's</m_str> (16_28) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>his father</m_str> (19_3) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Charles University in Prague</m_str> (20_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (20_10) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>Prague</m_str> (1_37) 	<m_str>Prague</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>Prague</m_str> (20_8) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
