<blue>1</blue>Mario Merz , an Italian artist whose installations exemplified the Arte Povera movement and its use of humble , often organic materials , died on Sunday at his home in Milan . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 78 . <br><blue>3</blue>He died in his sleep , and no cause of death was announced . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Merz belonged to a generation of artists who emerged following World War II and in different ways opened traditional painting and sculpture to a range of new mediums and forms . <br><blue>5</blue>Born in 1925 in Milan , he was close in age to artists like Joseph Beuys , Robert Rauschenberg , Donald Judd , Yves Klein , Piero Manzoni , Lee Bontecou , Michelangelo Pistoletto , Yayoi Kusama and Andy Warhol . <br><blue>6</blue>Most started working in oil on canvas and were drawn to the use of non-art materials or already existing objects or images in the pursuit of art that was more real , worldly and egalitarian . <br><blue>7</blue>The Italian arm of this tendency , christened Arte Povera by the young Italian critic Germano Celant in 1967 , included Mr. Pistoletto , Jannis Kounellis , Alighiero Boetti , Gilberto Zorio and a handful of other artists who exhibited together regularly during the late 1960 's and early 70 's and to this day maintain a coherence more usual to 19th-century and early-20th-century art movements . <br><blue>8</blue>The artists ' common ground included minimal forms combined with conceptual irreverence and a sense of rustic chic regarding materials and objects that was complemented by the centuries-old Italian buildings in which their work was often exhibited and photographed . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Merz 's installations -- permeated with ideas of growth and fecundity and spreading across floors , walls and ceilings -- had an exuberance that could be alternately carnivalesque or spare , pastoral and populist . <br><blue>10</blue>He became identified with great spiraling cornucopia-like glass tables stacked with fruits and vegetables , and makeshift clamped-together igloos made of mud , bundled twigs , loaves of bread or irregular pieces of glass , wax or slate . <br><blue>11</blue>In a 1967 interview Mr. Merz spoke of the importance of organic meaning and said , '' These are forms that stretch into space and therefore they are to be understood as a process of development . '' <br><blue>12</blue>Many of his installations were accented with words or numbers in neon . <br><blue>13</blue>The numbers counted off the Fibonacci progression , the mathematical formula for growth patterns found in many forms of life , including leaves , snail shells , pine cones and reptile skins . <br><blue>14</blue>( Both before and after he discovered the Fibonacci series , a frequent motif included lizards large and small , stuffed and painted . ) <br><blue>15</blue>It was not by chance that the Fibonacci progression was also the basis for the spiral , or that the igloo is a spiral in three dimensions . <br><blue>16</blue>The igloo , as a form of habitation , was consistent with another preferred form , the table , with its connotations of eating and conviviality . <br><blue>17</blue>In 1972 he illustrated the Fibonacci progression with a series of photographs of a factory workers ' lunchroom and a restaurant progressively crowded with diners . <br><blue>18</blue>His 1973 show at the John Weber Gallery in New York expressed the Fibonacci in a series of low modular tables . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Merz was a burly , energetic man whose flowing hair and jagged profile gave him an operatic demeanor . <br><blue>20</blue>He began drawing as a teenager , most seriously during the final months of World War II , when he was imprisoned for distributing anti-Fascist pamphlets in Milan . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>1967</m_str> (7_19) 	<m_str>1967</m_str> (11_3) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (1_15) 	<m_str>Arte Povera</m_str> (1_11) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>a frequent motif</m_str> (14_12) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (15_1) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>other artists who exhibited together regularly during the late 1960 's and early 70 's</m_str> (7_37) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (8_33) 	<m_str>The artists '</m_str> (8_1) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>great spiraling cornucopia-like glass tables stacked with fruits and vegetables</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>These</m_str> (11_18) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Merz 's installations</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>his installations</m_str> (12_3) 	<br><blue>7(18)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_28) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Merz</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Pistoletto</m_str> (7_22) 	<m_str>Mr. Merz 's</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Merz</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Merz</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (19_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_20) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>their work</m_str> (8_33) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Fibonacci progression</m_str> (13_5) 	<m_str>the Fibonacci progression</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>the Fibonacci progression</m_str> (17_5) 	<br><blue>10(3)</blue>: <m_str>Milan</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>Milan</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>Milan</m_str> (20_28) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
