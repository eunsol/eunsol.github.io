<blue>1</blue>William H. Rehnquist , who died Saturday at the age of 80 , almost a year after learning he had thyroid cancer , helped lead a conservative revolution on the Supreme Court during 19 years as chief justice of the United States . <br><blue>2</blue>Chief Justice 's Rehnquist 's death came six weeks after he refuted rumors that he would soon retire by announcing that he intended to serve as long as his health permitted . <br><blue>3</blue>At the time of the announcement , on July 14 , photographers had been camped out for weeks outside his house in Arlington , Va . <br><blue>4</blue>Following his diagnosis of cancer last October , the chief justice was treated with chemotherapy and radiation and missed months of the court 's arguments . <br><blue>5</blue>But he returned to the bench in March and participated actively in the court 's business , despite breathing and speaking through a hole that surgeons had cut in his throat . <br><blue>6</blue>Including 14 years as an associate justice , Chief Justice Rehnquist 's tenure on the court was not only one of the longest in the institution 's history but also one of the most consequential . <br><blue>7</blue>With a steady hand , a focus and commitment that never wavered , and the muscular use of the power of judicial review , he managed to translate many of his long-held views into binding national precedent . <br><blue>8</blue>Chief among those views was an enhanced role for the states within the federal system , which the court accomplished under his leadership by overturning dozens of federal laws that sought to project federal authority into what the Supreme Court majority viewed as the domain of the states . <br><blue>9</blue>In the zero-sum game of the tripartite separation of powers , the Supreme Court 's own power grew correspondingly as the justices circumscribed the power of Congress . <br><blue>10</blue>The court 's institutional enhancement was a paradox of Chief Justice Rehnquist 's tenure , because another goal that he accomplished in large measure was to shrink the role of the federal courts by taking them out of the business of running prisons , school systems and other institutions of government . <br><blue>11</blue>The Rehnquist years included one historic episode of galvanizing drama and deep divisiveness , the decision in Bush v. Gore that decided the 2000 presidential election by ending the recount in Florida and handing a wafer-thin victory to George W. Bush . <br><blue>12</blue>Though Chief Justice Rehnquist voted with the 5-to-4 majority , his central role in the case was largely behind the scenes and the controlling opinion did not carry his name . <br><blue>13</blue>While Chief Justice Rehnquist was a self-confident and not unduly modest man , that near-invisibility was itself quite characteristic and led many people to assume incorrectly that one of his flashier colleagues , Justice Antonin Scalia , had played the stage manager 's role in the events that led to the final decision in Bush v. Gore . '' <br><blue>14</blue>Rehnquist is the opposite of Scalia , '' Professor Robert C. Post of the Yale Law School said in an interview . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Rehnquist does n't particularly want to be noticed . <br><blue>16</blue>He 's not interested in getting credit . <br><blue>17</blue>He 's just interested in getting the job done . '' <br><blue>18</blue>Chief Justice Rehnquist also had the unusual experience of presiding over a presidential impeachment trial , a role ordained for the chief justice by the Constitution . <br><blue>19</blue>During the five weeks in early 1999 that it took the Senate to try and acquit President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice , the chief justice was an unfamiliar presence in the Senate chamber , occasionally moving the proceedings along but having little of substance to do . '' <br><blue>20</blue>I did nothing in particular and I did it very well , '' he told a television interviewer , Charlie Rose , two years later , borrowing a line from one of his favorite Gilbert and Sullivan operettas , '' Iolanthe .
