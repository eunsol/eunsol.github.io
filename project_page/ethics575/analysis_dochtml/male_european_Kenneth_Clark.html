<blue>1</blue>Kenneth B. Clark , the psychologist and educator whose 1950 report showing the destructive effect of school segregation influenced the United States Supreme Court to hold school segregation to be unconstitutional , died yesterday at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson , N.Y . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 90 . <br><blue>3</blue>His death was reported by his daughter , Kate C. Harris . <br><blue>4</blue>Dr. Clark was a leader in the civil rights movement that developed after World War II . <br><blue>5</blue>He was the first black to earn a doctorate in psychology from Columbia University , the first to become a tenured instructor in the City College system of New York and , in 1966 , the first black elected to the New York State Board of Regents . <br><blue>6</blue>He wrote several influential books and articles and used his considerable prestige in academic and professional circles and as a participant on many government bodies and Congressional committees to advance the cause of integration . <br><blue>7</blue>He battled white supremacists and black separatists alike because he believed that a '' racist system inevitably destroys and damages human beings ; it brutalizes and dehumanizes them , black and white alike . '' <br><blue>8</blue>It was his research with black schoolchildren that became a pillar of Brown v. Board of Education , the 1954 Supreme Court decision that toppled the '' separate but equal '' doctrine of racial segregation that prevailed in 21 states . <br><blue>9</blue>While for decades Dr. Clark was one of the great national authorities on integration , his effect was particularly profound in New York City and New York State . <br><blue>10</blue>Mayors and governors consulted him , and he expressed firm views about virtually every delicate racial matter from school busing to housing discrimination . <br><blue>11</blue>He was often fearless and blunt about his views , and willing to change them when the empirical evidence led him to believe that his original sentiments were wrong . <br><blue>12</blue>An early champion of a sweeping reorganization of New York City schools that gave greater control to community school boards , Dr. Clark later commented that '' the schools are no better and no worse than they were a decade ago . '' '' <br><blue>13</blue>In terms of the basic objective , '' he said , '' decentralization did not make a damn bit of difference . '' <br><blue>14</blue>Dr. Clark , who grew up in New York , gained firsthand knowledge of the effects of legally entrenched segregation in an extended visit , in the early 1950 's , to Clarendon County in central South Carolina . <br><blue>15</blue>Its school system had three times as many blacks as whites , but white students received more than 60 percent of the funds earmarked for education . <br><blue>16</blue>Dr. Clark administered a test , which he had devised years earlier , to 16 of those black children , who were ages 6 to 9 . <br><blue>17</blue>He showed them a black doll and a white doll and asked them what they thought of each . <br><blue>18</blue>Eleven of them said that the black doll looked '' bad , '' and nine of them thought that the white doll looked '' nice . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Seven of the 16 told Dr. Clark that they actually saw themselves as being closest to the white doll in appearance when asked , '' Now show me the doll that 's most like you . '' '' <br><blue>20</blue>These children saw themselves as inferior , and they accepted the inferiority as part of reality , '' Dr. Clark said . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>school segregation</m_str> (1_17) 	<m_str>school segregation</m_str> (1_27) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>21 states</m_str> (8_39) 	<br><blue>3(4)</blue>: <m_str>a white doll</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>the white doll</m_str> (18_20) 	<m_str>the black doll</m_str> (18_6) 	<m_str>the doll that 's most like you</m_str> (19_29) 	<br><blue>4(11)</blue>: <m_str>those black children , who were ages 6 to 9</m_str> (16_17) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (17_15) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (17_13) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>themselves</m_str> (19_12) 	<m_str>These children</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>themselves</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>human beings</m_str> (7_21) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the United States Supreme Court</m_str> (1_20) 	<m_str>Supreme Court</m_str> (8_21) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (7_24) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (8_1) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>integration</m_str> (6_34) 	<m_str>integration</m_str> (9_14) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>the destructive effect of school segregation</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>his effect</m_str> (9_16) 	<br><blue>10(27)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_36) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>Dr. Clark</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_3) 	<m_str>Dr. Clark</m_str> (9_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_8) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (11_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_25) 	<m_str>Dr. Clark</m_str> (12_22) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>Dr. Clark , who grew up in New York</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Clark</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Clark</m_str> (19_6) 	<m_str>Dr. Clark</m_str> (20_19) 	<br><blue>11(3)</blue>: <m_str>firm views</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>his views</m_str> (11_8) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (11_15) 	<br><blue>12(3)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (12_37) 	<m_str>New York City schools that gave greater control to community school boards</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>the schools</m_str> (12_28) 	<br><blue>13(1)</blue>: <m_str>New York City</m_str> (12_9) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (5_29) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (14_8) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
