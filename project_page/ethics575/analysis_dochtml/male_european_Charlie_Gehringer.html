<blue>1</blue>Charlie Gehringer , the unassuming Detroit Tiger whose .320 career batting average was quietly overshadowed by his reputation as one of baseball 's most accomplished second basemen , died on Thursday at a nursing home near his home in Bloomfield Hills , Mich . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 89 , and according to his wife , Josephine , had entered the nursing home after suffering a stroke last month . <br><blue>3</blue>Gehringer led the American League in hitting in 1937 with a .371 average , and was named its most valuable player that season . <br><blue>4</blue>He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1949 and had been its oldest living member . <br><blue>5</blue>Few Words , Many Hits During his 19 seasons with the Tigers , Gehringer was known as a colorless , taciturn player who spent his free time reading and doing crossword puzzles . <br><blue>6</blue>Except for a " hello " on opening day and a " goodbye " at the end of the season , he never seemed to have much to say in between . <br><blue>7</blue>But the man who attributed his smooth , rhythmic swing to the teachings of his former teammate and first manager , Ty Cobb , was uncommonly well spoken with a bat . <br><blue>8</blue>And he was a fielder of such effortless grace that he was described as poetry in motion . <br><blue>9</blue>Still , for all his acclaim as a sure-handed fielder , Gehringer almost never made a spectacular play . <br><blue>10</blue>Drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of American League hitters , he would simply glide into position , making the most challenging plays appear routine . <br><blue>11</blue>He seemed as artful at the plate , so much so that when someone challenged Lefty Gomez to defend his opinion that Gehringer was the game 's greatest second baseman , the great Yankee pitcher replied : " All I know is that whenever I 'm pitching , he 's on base . " <br><blue>12</blue>His performance was so steady and seemingly automatic that his nickname in the Motor City was Mechanical Man . <br><blue>13</blue>Charles Leonard Gehringer was born on a farm in Fowlerville , Mich. , about 60 miles north of Detroit , on May 11 , 1903 . <br><blue>14</blue>Partly , perhaps , because the usual alternative was slopping pigs , he liked baseball so much as a child that he and his brother carved out a diamond on the farm so they could play every day . <br><blue>15</blue>After a year at the University of Michigan , where he played both baseball and football , he left school for professional baseball , playing initially in the Michigan-Ontario League . <br><blue>16</blue>He made his first appearance with the Tigers for the last five games of the 1924 season , getting six hits in 13 at-bats . <br><blue>17</blue>Then , after a full season with Toronto of the International League , he was called back to Detroit for the last eight games of the 1925 season and stayed until he joined the Navy in 1942 . <br><blue>18</blue>In between , he hit above .300 for 13 seasons , had more than 200 hits seven times , had more than 100 runs batted seven times , led the league 's second basemen in fielding eight times , hit .321 over all in three World Series and appeared in six All-Star Games , including the first one in 1933 , compiling a .500 average . <br><blue>19</blue>He never made more than $ 35,000 a year playing baseball , but after four years as a Navy fitness instructor he became wealthy through an auto-accessories business . <br><blue>20</blue>Gehringer returned to the Tigers for a two-year stint as general manager at the end of the 1951 season , and later served as a Tigers vice president . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>the 1924 season</m_str> (16_15) 	<m_str>the 1951 season</m_str> (20_17) 	<m_str>the 1925 season</m_str> (17_26) 	<br><blue>2(43)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (17_32) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_22) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_11) 	<m_str>Lefty Gomez</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Gehringer</m_str> (11_23) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>Gehringer</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_22) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>the great Yankee pitcher</m_str> (11_32) 	<m_str>Charles Leonard Gehringer</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Gehringer</m_str> (5_14) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (11_40) 	<m_str>Gehringer</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (11_45) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (2_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_49) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_25) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>Gehringer</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_37) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>the man who attributed his smooth , rhythmic swing to the teachings of his former teammate and first manager , Ty Cobb</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_22) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_6) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Navy</m_str> (17_34) 	<m_str>Navy</m_str> (19_19) 	<br><blue>4(4)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>American League</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (3_18) 	<m_str>the American League</m_str> (3_3) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the league 's</m_str> (18_30) 	<m_str>the Michigan-Ontario League</m_str> (15_28) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the nursing home</m_str> (2_15) 	<m_str>a nursing home near his home</m_str> (1_33) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Tigers</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>the Tigers</m_str> (16_7) 	<m_str>Tigers</m_str> (20_26) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>a farm in Fowlerville , Mich. , about 60 miles north of Detroit , on May 11 , 1903</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>the farm</m_str> (14_31) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>the last eight games of the 1925 season</m_str> (17_21) 	<m_str>the last five games of the 1924 season</m_str> (16_10) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
