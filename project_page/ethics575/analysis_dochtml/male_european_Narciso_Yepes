<blue>1</blue>Narciso Yepes , a Spanish guitarist who expanded his instrument from its normal 6-string configuration to a setup using 10 strings and who made dozens of recordings of a repertory that ran from Renaissance to contemporary works , died yesterday in Murcia , Spain . <br><blue>2</blue>The Spanish news agency EFE said the cause was cancer . <br><blue>3</blue>He was 69 years old . <br><blue>4</blue>As a performer , Mr. Yepes had a deeply personal interpretive style in which individual notes were sharply delineated . <br><blue>5</blue>Compared with the more flowing style of his older contemporary , Andres Segovia , or the younger players who were influenced by Segovia , Mr. Yepes 's style could sound oddly clipped , yet his admirers pointed out that his approach allowed counterpoint to emerge with a clarity unusual on the guitar . <br><blue>6</blue>During his early years as a performer , he was most famous for expanding a traditional and fairly simple Spanish Romance into the main theme music of the 1952 Rene Clement film , '' Forbidden Games . '' <br><blue>7</blue>He also composed a film score for '' The Girl With the Golden Eyes '' in 1961 . <br><blue>8</blue>He made the first commercial recording of Joaquin Rodrigo 's popular '' Concert of Aranjuez '' in 1955 , and he often collaborated in concert and recordings with the great Spanish mezzo-soprano Teresa Berganza . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Yepes was born on Nov. 14 , 1927 in Lorca , a rural town in southeastern Spain , and was attracted to the guitar before he was 5 . <br><blue>10</blue>In interviews , he said his early music teachers , noting his inherent musicality , had tried to persuade him to abandon the guitar and learn the piano . <br><blue>11</blue>He refused and studied the instrument on his own for nearly a decade . <br><blue>12</blue>When he was 13 , he was admitted to the Valencia Conservatory , where the composer and pianist Vicente Asencio encouraged him to find an approach that would give the guitar the same clarity one heard on the piano . <br><blue>13</blue>Later , when he was well into his performing career , Mr. Yepes studied interpretation with the pianist Walter Gieseking , and harmony and composition with Georges Enescu and Nadia Boulanger . <br><blue>14</blue>It was not until the early 1960 's that Mr. Yepes began experimenting with the construction of the guitar , and by the time he added the four extra bass strings that became his trademark -- but which few other players adopted -- he was an established recitalist . <br><blue>15</blue>He made his concert debut in Madrid in 1947 , and toured Europe and South America in the 1950 's , with tours of Japan and the United States in the early 1960 's . <br><blue>16</blue>Mr. Yepes , like many guitarists of his generation who were seeking to expand their instrument 's repertory , did considerable research into the lute music of the 17th and 18th centuries , and transcribed many Renaissance , Baroque and early Classical works for modern performance . <br><blue>17</blue>He discovered that there had been isolated attempts in earlier times to expand the number of strings on the guitar . <br><blue>18</blue>Most tantalizingly , he found a method book by the 19th century guitarist-composer Ferdinando Carulli for an instrument called the decacordo , or 10-string guitar . <br><blue>19</blue>Reasoning that the guitar itself had grown larger and more robust since Carulli 's time , Mr. Yepes theorized that a modern version might find greater acceptance . <br><blue>20</blue>Using a principle common to the Baroque lute , he added four bass strings in descending whole steps , C , B flat , A flat and G flat . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>The Spanish news agency EFE</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_9) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (1_12) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the piano</m_str> (12_38) 	<m_str>the piano</m_str> (10_27) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the instrument</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>his instrument</m_str> (1_9) 	<br><blue>4(7)</blue>: <m_str>the guitar</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>the guitar</m_str> (10_23) 	<m_str>the guitar</m_str> (17_19) 	<m_str>the guitar</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>itself</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>the guitar</m_str> (5_51) 	<m_str>the guitar</m_str> (12_30) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>a performer</m_str> (4_2) 	<m_str>a performer</m_str> (6_6) 	<br><blue>6(40)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_25) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Yepes</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_34) 	<m_str>Joaquin Rodrigo 's</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Yepes , like many guitarists of his generation who were seeking to expand their instrument 's repertory</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Yepes</m_str> (19_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_44) 	<m_str>Mr. Yepes</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>the composer</m_str> (12_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>Andres Segovia</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (12_22) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Yepes</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Yepes 's</m_str> (5_25) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_27) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Yepes</m_str> (14_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_40) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (10_20) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>a deeply personal interpretive style in which individual notes were sharply delineated</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Yepes 's style</m_str> (5_25) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Baroque</m_str> (16_39) 	<m_str>Baroque</m_str> (20_7) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
