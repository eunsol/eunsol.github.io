<blue>1</blue>Auberon Waugh , an acerbic and often outrageous journalist , satirist and critic , and the eldest son of the novelist Evelyn Waugh , died on Tuesday at his home in Taunton , Somerset , England . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 61 . <br><blue>3</blue>He had been suffering from a heart condition and died in his sleep , his wife , Teresa , told the BBC . <br><blue>4</blue>Writing for a wide diversity of British newspapers and journals , including The Daily Telegraph , The New Statesman , Private Eye and The Literary Review , Mr. Waugh was as witty as he was iconoclastic . <br><blue>5</blue>With characteristic enthusiasm , he could sail into hyperbole . <br><blue>6</blue>As a columnist and critic , he was a happy practitioner of what he called '' the vituperative arts . '' <br><blue>7</blue>A kind of contemporary equivalent of Jonathan Swift , he became the scourge of pomposity and hypocrisy . <br><blue>8</blue>At various times , he was a political correspondent , book critic and novelist . <br><blue>9</blue>In seeming contradiction of his published persona , he was considered to be a charming and courteous man . <br><blue>10</blue>It was often suggested that in that sense he was the opposite of his father , who , it was said , put the best of himself into his books . <br><blue>11</blue>A devoted hedonist ( as well as a workaholic ) , he was a heavy smoker and wine drinker . <br><blue>12</blue>He had nine wine cellars in his home and wrote a column on the subject for Harper 's &amp; Queen magazine . <br><blue>13</blue>Disregarding doctorly advice , Mr. Waugh , known as Bron to his friends , continued all his bad habits and never lost his sense of humor . <br><blue>14</blue>So much of what he did in his life was in response to his famous father . <br><blue>15</blue>When his father was alive , he wrote to him every week , and after he died ( in 1966 ) , his son continued to think of him as an unseen correspondent . <br><blue>16</blue>As Auberon Waugh wrote in his autobiography , '' Will This Do ? '' <br><blue>17</blue>( published in the United States in 1998 ) , '' It was many years before I could break the habit of viewing every event with half an eye to the bulletin I would send to my father . <br><blue>18</blue>Even now , I find that when I hear a funny story about someone in whom he would have been interested -- the child of a friend , perhaps , or some grandee -- I mentally store it away to repeat to him . <br><blue>19</blue>There always follows a pang of bereavement when I remember that he is no longer around to hear it . '' <br><blue>20</blue>His father did not return the affection , once describing his son as '' clumsy , disheveled , sly , without intellectual , aesthetic or spiritual interest .
