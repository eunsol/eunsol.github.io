<blue>1</blue>Abram Games , whose powerful profusion of vivid posters cautioned , cajoled , delighted , educated and inspired the British home front during World War II , died in London on Aug. 27 . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 82 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Games was widely recognized as a 20th-century master of graphic art . <br><blue>4</blue>And as the British public discovered , his artistic motto was n't '' maximum meaning , minimum means , '' for nothing . <br><blue>5</blue>As Britain 's first and only official war poster designer , he brought his brush to bear on everything from the need for personal hygiene to the campaign against careless talk . <br><blue>6</blue>Along the way he created more than 100 posters whose stark and compelling images burned themselves into the collective consciousness of a nation at war . <br><blue>7</blue>A master of the visual pun , Mr. Games , a student of Dali and other Surrealists , was famous for his inspired use of trompe l'oeil . <br><blue>8</blue>In his hands a simple garden spade would become the prow of a ship ( '' Dig for Victory '' ) ; in one of his earliest posters , urging soldiers to keep their feet clean , the C in '' clean '' was sprouting toes . <br><blue>9</blue>Perhaps his most famous wartime image , designed for a campaign against loose talk , showed a spiral emerging from a soldier 's open mouth and spinning itself into a blood-red bayonet impaling three of his comrades . <br><blue>10</blue>Another poster depicting a dead British soldier lying face down on a coil of barbed wire became almost the signature image of wartime horror . <br><blue>11</blue>The son of a Latvian-born photographer and a seamstress , Abram Games was born in the East End of London in 1914 , 10 years after his parents arrived in England . <br><blue>12</blue>He had a checkered educational career , departing from one art school when he was told he had no artistic talent . <br><blue>13</blue>After working as an assistant to his father he found work in a commercial art studio . <br><blue>14</blue>But Mr. Games , who had a fierce , almost combative independence , was soon dismissed . <br><blue>15</blue>Setting up as a freelance artist at the age of 22 , he won a series of commissions from public agencies and private corporations . <br><blue>16</blue>He had barely begun to make a name for himself before war broke out in 1939 . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Games languished for a while as a hapless infantry private assigned to draw maps for training maneuvers , a task for which he found he was so ill-suited that , as he later recounted , '' I lost more convoys than any other draftsman . '' <br><blue>18</blue>His superiors agreed with his assessment . <br><blue>19</blue>But after he submitted a recruiting poster , Mr. Games , whose work had previously impressed corporate executives working with the War Office , was assigned to do posters full time . <br><blue>20</blue>Partly , perhaps , because the War Office had never had a full-time poster designer and had no experience in supervising one , Mr. Games was given virtually a free hand . <br><hr><br><blue>1(6)</blue>: <m_str>Dali</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_22) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_26) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_36) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>World War II</m_str> (1_24) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>a nation</m_str> (6_22) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (1_30) 	<m_str>the East End of London</m_str> (11_16) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the War Office</m_str> (19_21) 	<m_str>the War Office</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>work</m_str> (19_13) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>themselves</m_str> (6_16) 	<m_str>more than 100 posters</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>his earliest posters</m_str> (8_26) 	<br><blue>8(12)</blue>: <m_str>Abram Games , whose powerful profusion of vivid posters cautioned</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Games</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Games , a student of Dali and other Surrealists</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Games , who had a fierce , almost combative independence</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Games</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Games</m_str> (19_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Games</m_str> (20_24) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>a recruiting poster</m_str> (19_5) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>soldiers</m_str> (8_31) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (8_34) 	<br><blue>11(16)</blue>: <m_str>a Latvian-born photographer</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_27) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (16_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_33) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_24) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_26) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_3) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>itself</m_str> (9_28) 	<m_str>a soldier 's</m_str> (9_21) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
