<blue>1</blue>Jacques Derrida , the Algerian-born , French intellectual who became one of the most celebrated and notoriously difficult philosophers of the late 20th century , died Friday at a Paris hospital , the French president 's office announced . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 74 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause of death was pancreatic cancer , according to French television , The Associated Press reported . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Derrida was known as the father of deconstruction , the method of inquiry that asserted that all writing was full of confusion and contradiction , and that the author 's intent could not overcome the inherent contradictions of language itself , robbing texts -- whether literature , history or philosophy -- of truthfulness , absolute meaning and permanence . <br><blue>5</blue>The concept was eventually applied to the whole gamut of arts and social sciences , including linguistics , anthropology , political science , even architecture . <br><blue>6</blue>While he had a huge following -- larger in the United States than in Europe -- he was the target of as much anger as admiration . <br><blue>7</blue>For many Americans , in particular , he was the personification of a French school of thinking they felt was undermining many of the traditional standards of classical education , and one they often associated with divisive political causes . <br><blue>8</blue>Literary critics broke texts into isolated passages and phrases to find hidden meanings . <br><blue>9</blue>Advocates of feminism , gay rights , and third-world causes embraced the method as an instrument to reveal the prejudices and inconsistencies of Plato , Aristotle , Shakespeare , Freud and other '' dead white male '' icons of Western culture . <br><blue>10</blue>Architects and designers could claim to take a '' deconstructionist '' approach to buildings by abandoning traditional symmetry and creating zigzaggy , sometimes disquieting spaces . <br><blue>11</blue>The filmmaker Woody Allen titled one of his movies '' Deconstructing Harry , '' to suggest that his protagonist could best be understood by breaking down and analyzing his neurotic contradictions . <br><blue>12</blue>A Code Word for Discourse Toward the end of the 20th century , deconstruction became a code word of intellectual discourse , much as existentialism and structuralism -- two other fashionable , slippery philosophies that also emerged from France after World War II -- had been before it . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Derrida and his followers were unwilling -- some say unable -- to define deconstruction with any precision , so it has remained misunderstood , or interpreted in endlessly contradictory ways . <br><blue>14</blue>Typical of Mr. Derrida 's murky explanations of his philosophy was a 1993 paper he presented at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , in New York , which began : '' Needless to say , one more time , deconstruction , if there is such a thing , takes place as the experience of the impossible . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Mr. Derrida was a prolific writer , but his 40-plus books on various aspects of deconstruction were no more easily accessible . <br><blue>16</blue>Even some of their titles -- '' Of Grammatology , '' '' The Postcard : From Socrates to Freud and Beyond , '' and '' Ulysses Gramophone : Hear Say Yes in Joyce '' -- could be off-putting to the uninitiated . '' <br><blue>17</blue>Many otherwise unmalicious people have in fact been guilty of wishing for deconstruction 's demise -- if only to relieve themselves of the burden of trying to understand it , '' Mitchell Stephens , a journalism professor at New York University , wrote in a 1994 article in The New York Times Magazine . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Derrida 's credibility was also damaged by a 1987 scandal involving Paul de Man , a Yale University professor who was the most acclaimed exponent of deconstruction in the United States . <br><blue>19</blue>Four years after Mr. de Man 's death , it was revealed that he had contributed numerous pro-Nazi , anti-Semitic articles to a newspaper in Belgium , where he was born , while it was under German occupation during World War II . <br><blue>20</blue>In defending his dead colleague , Mr. Derrida , a Jew , was understood by some people to be condoning Mr. de Man 's anti-Semitism . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>Europe</m_str> (6_15) 	<br><blue>2(6)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (19_29) 	<m_str>Mr. de Man 's</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>Mr. de Man 's</m_str> (20_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_3) 	<m_str>his dead colleague</m_str> (20_3) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>Aristotle</m_str> (9_26) 	<m_str>Freud</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>Plato , Aristotle , Shakespeare , Freud</m_str> (9_24) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>the United States</m_str> (18_30) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>his 40-plus books on various aspects of deconstruction</m_str> (15_9) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Many otherwise unmalicious people</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>themselves</m_str> (17_21) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>deconstruction 's</m_str> (17_13) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (17_29) 	<m_str>deconstruction</m_str> (15_16) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>Paris</m_str> (1_30) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>France</m_str> (12_39) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>Belgium</m_str> (19_26) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>World War II</m_str> (12_41) 	<m_str>World War II</m_str> (19_40) 	<br><blue>12(20)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Derrida</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>the French president 's</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>Mr. Derrida 's</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Derrida</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Derrida , a Jew</m_str> (20_7) 	<m_str>the author 's</m_str> (4_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>The filmmaker Woody Allen</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_29) 	<m_str>Mr. Derrida</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Derrida 's</m_str> (14_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_15) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (13_21) 	<m_str>deconstruction</m_str> (13_15) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (7_33) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (7_18) 	<br><blue>15(3)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (19_34) 	<m_str>Mr. Derrida 's credibility</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (19_10) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
