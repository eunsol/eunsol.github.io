<blue>1</blue>Former Prime Minister Jack Lynch , who declined to send Irish troops to fight the British police in Northern Ireland at the start of the sectarian violence there 30 years ago , died today at a hospital in Dublin . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 82 and lived in Cork , his native city , south of Dublin . <br><blue>3</blue>His restraint is now widely seen as the beginning of a more tolerant Irish attitude toward British sovereignty in the Protestant-dominated North , leading ultimately to the peace effort in 1993 that produced the peace agreement of 1998 . <br><blue>4</blue>The accord gives Roman Catholics more political power while keeping the province British , and though implementation is stalled , it is still alive . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Lynch , a tall , pipe-smoking former star athlete in hurling and Gaelic football , also moved Ireland into the European Economic Community in 1973 , when the country was suffering a depressed economy and losing tens of thousands of emigrants . <br><blue>6</blue>Billions of dollars of European aid gradually helped Ireland become one of the world 's 25 richest nations , with an unemployment rate half the European Union average . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Lynch was Prime Minister , or Taoiseach ( TEE-shuck ) , from 1966 to 1973 and from 1977 to 1979 . <br><blue>8</blue>In 1969 he resisted pressure from his party , Fianna Fail , and from many people in Ireland to send troops across the northern border to protect Catholics in Londonderry who were under attack by the police and Protestant paramilitaries . <br><blue>9</blue>Hopes of militant nationalists had been raised when he said , '' It is clear the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people being injured , or worse . '' <br><blue>10</blue>British officials found the remark inflammatory , but Mr. Lynch never did order troops to invade the northern province . <br><blue>11</blue>He also established field hospitals along the border for Catholics coming south to avoid violence in the north . <br><blue>12</blue>In 1990 , after he had retired from politics , Mr. Lynch said sending in the troops , a tactic that he considered to persuade the United Nations to send a peacekeeping mission , could have killed 250,000 civilians and soldiers in an Irish-British war . <br><blue>13</blue>When Mr. Lynch had traveled to Belfast earlier to discuss peace with British officials , the flamboyant Protestant leader and self-professed anti-Catholic , the Rev. Ian Paisley , led a group of Protestant politicians in pelting Mr. Lynch 's car with snowballs . <br><blue>14</blue>But by the late 70 's Mr. Lynch was talking about peace and tolerance with Margaret Thatcher , then the British Prime Minister . <br><blue>15</blue>He had also assuaged British misgivings -- while provoking Irish Republican anger -- when he dismissed Charles J. Haughey from his Cabinet in 1970 . <br><blue>16</blue>Mr. Haughey , who succeeded Mr. Lynch as Prime Minister in 1979 , was accused and acquitted in an Irish court of plotting to send guns to northern Catholics . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Haughey , whose finances are now under scrutiny by two special tribunals and who is alleged to have taken millions of dollars in gifts from business executives and loan write-offs from banks , declined today to discuss their differences , saying only that Mr. Lynch '' had a capacity to reassure the public . '' <br><blue>18</blue>The current Prime Minister , Bertie Ahern , said of Mr. Lynch , '' His firm leadership saw the nation through a period of great political tension and turbulence , and his outstanding work to gain Irish membership in the E.E.C. changed forever the way we see ourselves as a nation . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Lynch is survived by his wife , Mairin , The Associated Press reported . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>the province</m_str> (4_11) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (4_21) 	<m_str>the northern province</m_str> (10_17) 	<br><blue>2(22)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Lynch</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynch</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_22) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynch</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynch</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynch 's</m_str> (13_37) 	<m_str>70 's Mr. Lynch</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_21) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynch</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynch</m_str> (17_45) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_32) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynch</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Lynch</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_6) 	<br><blue>3(4)</blue>: <m_str>the country</m_str> (5_29) 	<m_str>Ireland</m_str> (5_19) 	<m_str>Ireland</m_str> (6_9) 	<m_str>Ireland</m_str> (8_18) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Catholics</m_str> (8_28) 	<m_str>Catholics</m_str> (11_10) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Charles J.
