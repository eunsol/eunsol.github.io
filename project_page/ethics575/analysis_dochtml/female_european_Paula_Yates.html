<blue>1</blue>Paula Yates , a British television personality known for her outrageously flirtatious interviewing style and for her relationships with the rock stars Bob Geldof and Michael Hutchence , was found dead at home here on Sunday . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 40 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was apparently a drug overdose , the authorities said . <br><blue>4</blue>Reared in north Wales , Ms. Yates left school at 16 and moved to London , where she joined the emerging punk scene and embarked on an extravagant -- and extravagantly public -- life . <br><blue>5</blue>When she became enamored of Mr. Geldof , who was then the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats , she followed the band on tour until Mr. Geldof became just as smitten with her , and they embarked on a relationship . <br><blue>6</blue>They married 10 years later and had three daughters , Fifi Trixibelle , Peaches and Pixie . <br><blue>7</blue>Ms. Yates reveled in the spotlight , posing naked in the stuffy Reform Club for Penthouse magazine and compiling a book of photographs called '' Rock Stars in Their Underpants , '' which Andy Warhol called '' the greatest work of art in the last decade . '' <br><blue>8</blue>She also wrote several books for children , but it was not until she started her television career as a co-presenter of '' The Tube , '' a show about music , that she became a celebrity in her own right , affecting a bubbleheaded , giggly personality that belied her sharp intelligence , friends said . <br><blue>9</blue>In 1992 she began presenting '' The Big Breakfast Show , '' a morning television program in which she often interviewed guests while lying on a bed in the studio . <br><blue>10</blue>One guest was Michael Hutchence , the lead singer of the band INXS , and the two fell madly in love . <br><blue>11</blue>She left Mr. Geldof , setting off a bitter , tabloid-fueled divorce and an equally bitter fight for custody of their three daughters . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Geldof won . <br><blue>13</blue>Ms. Yates and Mr. Hutchence had an intensely passionate affair and one child , a daughter they named Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily . <br><blue>14</blue>But their relationship was marred by drug use and extreme behavior that ended when Mr. Hutchence was found dead , hanging by his belt , in a hotel room in Sydney , Australia , in November 1997 . <br><blue>15</blue>Ms. Yates , who once said that Mr. Hutchence was '' God 's gift to women , '' seemed never to recover from his death , spiraling into a depression that resulted in her admission to a mental hospital and at least one suicide attempt of her own . <br><blue>16</blue>It was hard for her to hang on , she once said in an interview . '' <br><blue>17</blue>It 's only the mothering instinct that makes you willing to suffer every day , '' she said . '' <br><blue>18</blue>Right now , I think living is a noble gesture .
