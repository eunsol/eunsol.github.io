<blue>1</blue>Jacques Ellul , a French Protestant theologian whose pessimistic assessment of modern technological society found a receptive American audience in the late 1960 's , died on Thursday at his home in Bordeaux , France . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 82 . <br><blue>3</blue>From 1946 to 1980 , he was a professor of law and history at the University of Bordeaux 's law school and its Institute of Political Studies . <br><blue>4</blue>Although 20 of his 43 books have been translated into English , Mr. Ellul was most widely known in the United States for " The Technological Society , " written in the 1950 's but published here in 1964 by Alfred A. Knopf . <br><blue>5</blue>The book 's description of a modern society in which technical efficiency had become an end in itself found an audience in the late 1960 's among Americans disillusioned by the nation 's political disarray . <br><blue>6</blue>Book Is Criticized But his bleak portrait of humanity enslaved by its own technology did not go uncriticized . <br><blue>7</blue>In 1970 , noting that Mr. Ellul 's books were " enjoying a campus vogue , " Alvin Toffler , in his best-selling book " Future Shock , " called the French writer " one of the most extreme " of " a generation of future-haters and technophobes . " <br><blue>8</blue>Like many American readers of " The Technological Society , " Mr. Toffler devoted little attention to the religious underpinnings of Mr. Ellul 's thought , except to refer to him as " a French religious mystic . " <br><blue>9</blue>In fact , Mr. Ellul 's views were rooted in an austere Christian faith to which he had been converted during his university studies . <br><blue>10</blue>At the same time he was drawn to Marxism . <br><blue>11</blue>Although he later denounced Communism , he was left with a lifelong inclination to identify the struggle of rival interests and the potential for control in every social institution , from the nation state to the media . <br><blue>12</blue>That combination made him a critic of the status quo . <br><blue>13</blue>At the same time , he warned that hope in solving contemporary problems through technological , scientific or political schemes was misplaced , and that human efforts apart from God 's grace would always be self-destructive . <br><blue>14</blue>Political radicals who embraced his social criticism eventually discovered that he was equally critical of " the political illusion , " the title of another of his books , and what he considered the totalitarian pretensions of modern bureaucracies . <br><blue>15</blue>Calvinist Influences His writings resemble a Calvinist preacher 's insistence on the depravity and pridefulness of modern civilization , to which only God can be a sufficient answer . <br><blue>16</blue>They contained the traditional themes of Reformed Christian theology : the sovereignty of God over history , human sinfulness , hope through faith rather than human works . <br><blue>17</blue>He was born in Bordeaux on Jan. 6 , 1912 , into a poor family that was not particularly religious . <br><blue>18</blue>His father was a freethinker and his mother was a Protestant . <br><blue>19</blue>After receiving his law degree from the University of Paris , he married Yvette Lensvelt in 1937 . <br><blue>20</blue>Politically active during the 1930 's and briefly a member of the Communist Party , Mr. Ellul was removed by the Vichy Government in 1940 from his post as a law professor at the University of Strasbourg . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the University of Paris</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>the University of Strasbourg</m_str> (20_34) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>1960 's</m_str> (1_23) 	<m_str>1960 's</m_str> (5_25) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the same time</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>the same time</m_str> (13_2) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>University of Bordeaux 's</m_str> (3_16) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (3_23) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>itself</m_str> (5_18) 	<m_str>The book 's description of a modern society in which technical efficiency had become an end in itself</m_str> (5_1) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>his 43 books</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Ellul 's books</m_str> (7_6) 	<m_str>his books</m_str> (14_27) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Bordeaux</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>Bordeaux</m_str> (17_5) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>The book 's</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his best-selling book</m_str> (7_22) 	<br><blue>9(30)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_30) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_4) 	<m_str>Mr. Ellul</m_str> (4_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_22) 	<m_str>Mr. Ellul 's</m_str> (7_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Ellul 's</m_str> (8_22) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (8_31) 	<m_str>Mr. Ellul 's</m_str> (9_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_22) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_27) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_32) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>Calvinist Influences His</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Ellul</m_str> (20_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_27) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
