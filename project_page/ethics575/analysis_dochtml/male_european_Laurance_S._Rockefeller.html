<blue>1</blue>Laurance S. Rockefeller , the middle brother of the five prominent and philanthropic grandsons of John D. Rockefeller , who concentrated his own particular generosity on conservation , recreation , ecological concerns and medical research , particularly the treatment of cancer , died yesterday at his home in Manhattan . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 94 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause of death was pulmonary fibrosis , according to a family spokesman , Fraser P. Seitel . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Seitel said that as recently as Wednesday , Mr. Rockefeller , whose health had declined in the last several months , had gone to work at his offices at Rockefeller Center , where he joked with the staff that he was putting in only half a day . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Rockefeller 's career began on Wall Street almost 70 years ago , and he became a trailblazer of modern venture capitalism , compounding his inherited wealth many times over . <br><blue>6</blue>In the decades since he first took his seat on the New York Stock Exchange , he often used his native instinct for identifying the next big thing . <br><blue>7</blue>He was not content with simply making more money but wanted to make the money produce something of lasting value . <br><blue>8</blue>In the late 1930 's , he provided much of the capital to help Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker , the World War I fighter pilot , start Eastern Airlines and was for many years the airline 's largest stockholder . <br><blue>9</blue>He invested -- personally or through a family partnership he established -- in hundreds of start-ups , initially in aviation and electronics and later branching out to computers ( Intel and Apple ) and biotechnology . <br><blue>10</blue>His gifts of land , from Wyoming to the Virgin Islands , amounted to hundreds of thousands of acres , including a prominent New York vista that contained a vast unspoiled tract along the west bank of the lower Hudson River : Tallman Mountain State Park . <br><blue>11</blue>Less gregarious than his older brother Nelson , the four-term governor of New York and the vice president under Gerald R. Ford , Laurance Spelman Rockefeller was also more reserved and private than his flamboyant younger brother Winthrop , who was governor of Arkansas . <br><blue>12</blue>A philosophy major at Princeton , he long wrestled with the question of how he might most efficiently and satisfyingly use the great wealth into which he was born . <br><blue>13</blue>In the process , he shaped a life that was also distinct from that of his oldest brother , John D. 3rd , who devoted himself to maintaining the charitable efforts established by his father and grandfather , and of his youngest brother , the scholarly David , who headed the Chase bank and was deeply involved in issues of international finance and politics . <br><blue>14</blue>David Rockefeller , who is the last surviving grandchild of John D. Rockfeller , said yesterday of Laurance , '' His inspiration and wisdom will be missed by every generation of the Rockefeller family and most especially by me . '' <br><blue>15</blue>In his 1997 biography '' Laurance S. Rockefeller , Catalyst for Conservation , '' Robin Winks said that more than 200 books had been published about the Rockefeller family . <br><blue>16</blue>He wrote that '' one may read all these books , some friendly , some angry , to discover that there is one Rockefeller who is barely present in most of them . <br><blue>17</blue>This is Laurance , who moves in and out for a page or so and is then gone , neglected by an author who sometimes is in search of scandal or the stuff of headlines , or whose interests are in politics , high finance , or international affairs . '' <br><blue>18</blue>As a result , most of these books have neglected the Rockefeller who , in the tradition of grandfather and father , arguably has moved and shaken to the most long-range purpose -- the preservation of the nation 's natural heritage , of great historic landscapes . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Using significant amounts of his money , as well as his connections , prestige and negotiating skills , Mr. Rockefeller was instrumental in establishing and enlarging national parks in Wyoming , California , the Virgin Islands , Vermont , Maine and Hawaii . <br><blue>20</blue>In his home state , New York , he expended further cash and influence to help establish parklands and urban open spaces . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>his flamboyant younger brother Winthrop , who was governor of Arkansas</m_str> (11_34) 	<m_str>his oldest brother</m_str> (13_16) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Princeton</m_str> (12_5) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Rockefeller family</m_str> (14_32) 	<m_str>the Rockefeller family</m_str> (15_27) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Hawaii</m_str> (19_42) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Maine</m_str> (19_40) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (16_32) 	<m_str>all these books , some friendly</m_str> (16_8) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>more than 200 books</m_str> (15_19) 	<m_str>these books</m_str> (18_7) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>more money</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>the money</m_str> (7_14) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (10_24) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (11_13) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>10(4)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_11) 	<br><blue>11(1)</blue>: <m_str>Wall Street</m_str> (5_7) 	<br><blue>12(43)</blue>: <m_str>Laurance</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (14_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_41) 	<m_str>Laurance S.
