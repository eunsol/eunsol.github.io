<blue>1</blue>Robert M. W. Kempner , who was a member of the United States prosecution staff at the Nuremberg war crimes trials and who wrote about the Nazi era , died Sunday in Frankfurt , Germany , where he practiced law . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 93 and also had a home in Lansdowne , Pa . <br><blue>3</blue>He had been in ill health for months , but continued to do some work on his legal practice , The Associated Press reported from Berlin yesterday . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Kempner was born in Germany , spent his early years there and became the senior legal adviser to the police in Prussia and an opponent of Nazism . <br><blue>5</blue>He left Germany after Hitler came to power and settled in the United States , where he did research on European dictatorships at the University of Pennsylvania and was a consultant to the Department of Justice and other Government agencies . <br><blue>6</blue>While Mr. Kempner worked with the team of prosecutors at the Nuremberg trials that followed the Nazi surrender at the end of World War II in Europe , his familiarity with German police methods provided useful insights , Telford Taylor wrote in the book " The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials , " which came out in 1992 . <br><blue>7</blue>The Case Against Goring At Nuremberg , Mr. Kempner 's work included heading the prosecutorial unit that drew up the case against Hermann Goring , one of the main figures in the Hitler regime , and against other Nazis who were defendants at the principal war crimes trial there . <br><blue>8</blue>He also was credited with finding , in 1947 among diplomatic archives in what was then West Germany , what became widely known as the Wannsee Protocol . <br><blue>9</blue>This was a record of a conference in January 1942 at which high-level Nazis approved plans for what later became known as the Holocaust but in Nazi jargon was termed " the final solution " of the Jewish problem . <br><blue>10</blue>Justifying the Nuremberg trials , which were carried out by the victorious allies , Mr. Kempner once observed , " It was in accordance with the tradition of our legal history that the ' victors ' should be the executors of justice in the occupied country after the war . " <br><blue>11</blue>Robert Max Wasilii Kempner was born in Freiburg , Germany , on Oct. 17 , 1899 , the son of Walter K. Kempner and the former Lydia Rabinowitsch . <br><blue>12</blue>He studied law , political science and other subjects at the universities of Berlin , Breslau and Freiburg . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1951 Mr. Kempner began his law practice in Frankfurt . <br><blue>14</blue>He also spoke out repeatedly about the Nazi era . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1960 , he served as an expert witness at the trial , in Israel , of Adolf Eichmann , who helped carry out the " final solution " as an SS officer . <br><blue>16</blue>In an interview some years ago , Mr. Kempner said that scientists implicated in experiments carried out by the Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele had escaped notice after World War II . <br><blue>17</blue>In 1981 he described Karl Doenitz , the Grand Admiral who administered the German Reich for 23 days in 1945 until the unconditional surrender that ended World War II in Europe , as a loyal assistant to Hitler . <br><blue>18</blue>Admiral Doenitz was convicted by the Nuremberg tribunal of war crimes . <br><blue>19</blue>After initiative by Mr. Kempner , a subsidiary of the giant West German Flick industrial empire paid an indemnity of more than $ 2 million in 1986 to a New York-based organization representing the interests of Jews who were used as slave laborers by the Nazis . <br><blue>20</blue>The payment by the subsidiary brought to a conclusion a long attempt by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany to obtain reparations for 1,300 survivors who had been forced to work in gunpowder factories during World War II . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the subsidiary</m_str> (20_4) 	<m_str>a subsidiary of the giant West German Flick industrial empire</m_str> (19_7) 	<br><blue>2(25)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Kempner 's</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Kempner</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Kempner</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Hitler</m_str> (7_33) 	<m_str>Mr. Kempner</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>Hitler</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>This</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Kempner</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Kempner</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_38) 	<m_str>Mr. Kempner</m_str> (10_15) 	<m_str>Robert Max Wasilii Kempner</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Nuremberg trials that followed the Nazi surrender at the end of World War II in Europe , his familiarity with German police methods provided useful insights</m_str> (6_11) 	<m_str>the Nuremberg Trials</m_str> (6_49) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Frankfurt</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>Frankfurt</m_str> (13_10) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>his law practice</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>his legal practice</m_str> (3_17) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>1,300 survivors who had been forced to work in gunpowder factories during World War II</m_str> (20_26) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>United States</m_str> (1_12) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Nazi era</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>the Nazi era</m_str> (1_26) 	<br><blue>9(5)</blue>: <m_str>Nuremberg</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>Nuremberg</m_str> (1_18) 	<m_str>Nuremberg</m_str> (18_7) 	<m_str>Nuremberg</m_str> (7_6) 	<m_str>Nuremberg</m_str> (10_3) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>Berlin</m_str> (3_26) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>Admiral Doenitz</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Karl Doenitz , the Grand Admiral who administered the German Reich for 23 days in 1945 until the unconditional surrender that ended World War II in Europe , as a loyal assistant to Hitler</m_str> (17_5) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>the victorious allies</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>our</m_str> (10_29) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele had escaped notice after World War II</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>the war</m_str> (10_48) 	<br><blue>14(3)</blue>: <m_str>Germany</m_str> (5_3) 	<m_str>Germany</m_str> (20_21) 	<m_str>Germany</m_str> (4_6) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>Freiburg</m_str> (11_8) 	<m_str>Freiburg</m_str> (12_18) 	<br><blue>16(4)</blue>: <m_str>World War II</m_str> (20_38) 	<m_str>World War II</m_str> (17_27) 	<m_str>World War II</m_str> (6_23) 	<m_str>World War II</m_str> (16_29) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
