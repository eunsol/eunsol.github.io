<blue>1</blue>Otto L. Bettmann , who fled to New York from Nazi Germany in 1935 with two trunks of prints and photographs and founded the renowned Bettmann Archive , a commercial treasure house of pictorial material that percolated into American culture through newspapers , magazines , books and television , died on Friday at Boca Raton Community Hospital in Florida . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 94 . <br><blue>3</blue>Dr. Bettmann , who sold the archive 17 years ago and continued to write and publish books that drew on images from his collection and on his scholarship in music , art , literature and other subjects , died of kidney failure and age , a granddaughter , Ellen Stolzman , said last night . <br><blue>4</blue>When sold to the Kraus-Thomson Organization in 1981 , the archive consisted of five million photos , prints , woodcuts , posters , cartoons and other graphic material that chronicled the history of civilization , including many medical and technical drawings and images of personalities and events of the 20th century . <br><blue>5</blue>In 1990 , the archive acquired 11.5 million photographic images , most of them from the photo libraries of United Press International and Reuters . <br><blue>6</blue>Many were cultural icons : Winston Churchill giving the victory sign , an astronaut on the moon , Albert Einstein sticking out his tongue , Marilyn Monroe standing over a subway grate as her skirt blew up . <br><blue>7</blue>William H. Gates , chairman of the Microsoft Corporation , bought the archive in 1995 through his Corbis Corporation as a step toward building a huge library of digitally stored images that may someday be sampled and sold on computer disks or over computer networks . <br><blue>8</blue>The terms of the 1981 and 1995 transactions were not disclosed , but were believed to be multimillion-dollar deals . <br><blue>9</blue>Dr. Bettmann , who began collecting prints and photos as a boy and earned a doctorate at Leipzig University , was curator of rare books in the Prussian State Art Library in Berlin when Hitler came to power in 1933 . <br><blue>10</blue>He was dismissed for being Jewish . <br><blue>11</blue>In 1935 , when Jews could still emigrate but take little of value with them , he managed to get past Nazi customs with two trunks bulging with 25,000 images , many of them on film negatives he had made . '' <br><blue>12</blue>It was a wonderfully auspicious time to arrive , '' Dr. Bettmann recalled . <br><blue>13</blue>Life and Look magazines were on the scene and the era of photojournalism was in its heyday . <br><blue>14</blue>Budget-conscious editors were clamoring for illustrations . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Everybody wanted pictures , and I had two trunks full , '' he said . <br><blue>16</blue>Working out of a small midtown office that was crammed with filing cabinets , Dr. Bettmann rented his images for one-time use , sometimes for $ 25 , often for thousands of dollars , depending on the size of the audience . <br><blue>17</blue>He was soon making a handsome living . <br><blue>18</blue>In 1938 , CBS asked him for something to illustrate fledgling radio for an advertisement . <br><blue>19</blue>He came up with a 300-year-old line drawing by a Jesuit priest of a medieval castle with huge snail-shaped trumpets that transmitted sound from room to room . <br><blue>20</blue>The ad won awards for CBS and gave the small archive a name . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_27) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>Life</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>CBS</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>CBS</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Marilyn Monroe</m_str> (6_26) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_34) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Microsoft Corporation</m_str> (7_7) 	<m_str>his Corbis Corporation</m_str> (7_17) 	<br><blue>6(4)</blue>: <m_str>the archive</m_str> (3_6) 	<m_str>the archive</m_str> (4_10) 	<m_str>the archive</m_str> (5_4) 	<m_str>the archive</m_str> (7_12) 	<br><blue>7(3)</blue>: <m_str>Jews</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (11_15) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (11_34) 	<br><blue>8(11)</blue>: <m_str>Hitler</m_str> (9_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_38) 	<m_str>Dr. Bettmann</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_13) 	<m_str>Dr. Bettmann</m_str> (16_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (18_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>Albert Einstein</m_str> (6_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_17) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
