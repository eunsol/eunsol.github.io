 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>A. L. Rowse , the brilliant authority on Shakespeare and Elizabethan England whose grandiose opinions of his scholarship were not always shared by rival historians he invariably dismissed as third-rate , died on Friday at his home in Cornwall . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 93 and best known for his confident identification of '' the Dark Lady '' of Shakespeare 's sonnets . <br><blue>3</blue>During a career in which he turned out some 90 books -- among them a monumental four-volume study of the Elizabethan age , two biographies of Shakespeare and an exhaustively annotated edition of Shakespeare 's complete works -- Mr. Rowse awed reviewers with both the brilliance of his writing and the sheer scope his scholarship . <br><blue>4</blue>If he had not , as one suggested , read everything written during or about 16th-century England , he had read enough to speak with uncommon authority and never hesitated to do so , even if his pronouncements seemed to go beyond the evidence at hand . <br><blue>5</blue>Even before the publication of his 1964 book '' William Shakespeare : A Biography , '' for instance , Mr. Rowse made headlines on both sides of the Atlantic -- and created a run on bookstores -- by announcing that he had solved all but one of the problems of the sonnets , including their dates ( 1592-95 ) and the identity of the poet 's unnamed rival ( Christopher Marlowe ) . <br><blue>6</blue>It was left to spoil-sport reviewers to point out that the only thing original about the discoveries was that unlike a number of earlier scholars who had come to pretty much the same conclusions from essentially the same record , Mr. Rowse alone was not dissuaded by the lack of definitive evidence from proclaiming his conclusions as incontrovertible facts . <br><blue>7</blue>A decade later , just before the 1973 publication of his second biography , '' Shakespeare the Man , '' Mr. Rowse won a new round of headlines by announcing that he had solved the last mystery of the sonnets : the identity of Shakespeare 's mistress known as the Dark Lady . <br><blue>8</blue>Drawing on circumstantial evidence , he identified her as one Emilia Bassano Lanier , the daughter of an Italian court musician . <br><blue>9</blue>As for recent scholarly work insisting that most of the sonnets were written to a gay lover , Mr. Rowse , who was himself openly gay , had tried to nip that error in the bud , finding irrefutable scholarly evidence that Shakespeare was '' a strongly sexed heterosexual '' and a man '' more than a little interested in women -- for an Englishman . '' <br><blue>10</blue>Mr. Rowse , who had divined Lanier as the Dark Lady from a close and inspired reading of the sonnets and the diaries of a well-known Elizabethan figure , Simon Forman , knew when he was on to a good thing . <br><blue>11</blue>He also knew the value of a catchy title . <br><blue>12</blue>Three years later , in 1976 , he used the diaries as the basis of a full-blown sociological study he called '' Sex and Society in the Elizabethan Age . '' <br><blue>13</blue>If his pronouncements and his outspoken disdain for virtually every other scholar in his field made him an object of some controversy , Mr. Rowse reveled in it as a man who seemed to take delight in going against the grain , even his own . <br><blue>14</blue>Indeed , his very life as an Oxford don ensconced in the academic splendor of All Souls , a college of such rarefied scholarship that it has no students , seemed to belie his own upbringing . <br><blue>15</blue>For Alfred Leslie Rowse , whose erudition and refined speech came to personify the pinnacle of upper-class England , grew up in a home without books in Cornwall , that narrow Celtic refuge that stretches into the Atlantic in southwest England . <br><blue>16</blue>The son of a china clay miner , Mr. Rowse , whose parents were barely literate , was a brilliant student who learned to read by the age of 4 , became obsessed with speaking precisely correct English and worked so hard to win the only Cornwall scholarship to Oxford that it almost ruined his already precarious health . <br><blue>17</blue>As soon as he got to Christ Church College , Mr. Rowse knew that he had found his spiritual home at Oxford , but he remained so fiercely loyal to his native Cornwall that he always maintained a home there and wrote extensively about Cornwall and Cornish culture , including '' Tudor Cornwall '' ( 1941 ) and '' The Cousin Jacks '' ( 1969 ) , a study of the Cornish in the United States . <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Rowse , who had been writing poetry since he was a child and had intended to study literature , was persuaded to switch to history at Oxford and never regretted it . <br><blue>19</blue>After being elected a fellow of All Souls at the age of 22 , he threw himself into the scholarly life with a couple of detours into politics , making two unsuccessful runs for a Labor seat in Parliament in the 1930 's . <br><blue>20</blue>It was a reflection of the range of his early interests that in successive years in the 1930 's he published '' Queen Elizabeth and her Subjects , '' and '' Mr. Keynes and the Labor Movement .
