<blue>1</blue>Carl B. Stokes , whose election as the first black mayor of a major city in 1967 became a symbol of a changing America , died early yesterday in Cleveland . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 68 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Stokes , who was the United States Ambassador to the Seychelles but had taken a medical leave of absence last year after being told he had cancer of the esophagus , died shortly after 5 A.M. at Cleveland Clinic , according to a spokeswoman for the hospital . <br><blue>4</blue>In a career marked by the overcoming of racial barriers , Mr. Stokes also served in the Ohio Legislature , presided as a municipal judge in Cleveland and was the first black anchorman of a television news show in New York . <br><blue>5</blue>The great-grandson of a slave , Mr. Stokes became Mayor of Cleveland by defeating Seth C. Taft , the grandson of a President , at a time when whites accounted for two-thirds of the city 's population . <br><blue>6</blue>As Mayor , he steered a relatively moderate course , calling for calm and unity during the social and racial turbulence of the late 1960 's that engulfed Cleveland and many other big cities . <br><blue>7</blue>Thrust into the fore of urban politics at a time of such upheaval , Mr. Stokes seemed to relish the challenge , even as many whites viewed him with hostility . <br><blue>8</blue>" I 'm glad I was born during the times I was , " he once said . <br><blue>9</blue>Mr. Stokes 's brother Louis , a Representative from Ohio , said yesterday that his brother had " inspired black Americans to aspire to higher political office all over the country . " <br><blue>10</blue>Born in the poor black neighborhood of Central in 1927 , Carl Stokes was only 2 when his father , Charles , a laundry worker , died . <br><blue>11</blue>Raised in a public housing project for the poor by their mother , Louise , a cleaning woman , the Stokes boys would help support the family by carrying newspapers and working in neighborhood stores . <br><blue>12</blue>After dropping out of high school and going to work in a foundry , Carl Stokes entered the Army in 1944 , and served in occupied Germany in World War II . <br><blue>13</blue>After being discharged in 1946 , he returned to Cleveland and earned a high school diploma , and then attended West Virginia State College and Cleveland College of Western Reserve University , majoring in psychology . <br><blue>14</blue>He worked for three years as an agent for Ohio 's State Department of Liquor Control , and then returned to school at the University of Minnesota , where he earned a bachelor 's of science degree in law in 1954 . <br><blue>15</blue>He then worked as a probation officer in Cleveland while attending the Cleveland-Marshall Law School , and in 1957 was admitted to the bar . <br><blue>16</blue>Mr. Stokes became the first black Democrat elected to the Legislature in 1962 , winning office in Cuyahoga County , which was only 14 percent black . <br><blue>17</blue>In 1965 , he narrowly missed upsetting the incumbent , Ralph S. Locher , in the Cleveland mayoral race . <br><blue>18</blue>On the night of his election victory in 1967 , Mr. Stokes told a crowd of cheering supporters that he had never before then known " the full meaning of the words ' God Bless America . ' " <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Stokes was credited with using humor and hard work to ease the misgivings of Cleveland 's white voters . <br><blue>20</blue>He said after his election that white opponents thought the city 's overwhelming white majority would give them an easy time , but " Carl Stokes fooled them .
