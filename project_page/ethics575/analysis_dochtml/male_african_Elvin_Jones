<blue>1</blue>Elvin Jones , whose explosive drumming powered the John Coltrane Quartet , the most influential and controversial jazz ensemble of the 1960 's , died yesterday in Manhattan . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 76 and lived in Manhattan and Nagasaki , Japan . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Jones 's death , which came after several months of failing health , was announced by John DeChristopher , director of artist relations for the Avedis Zildjian Company , maker of Mr. Jones 's cymbals . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Jones continued to perform until a few weeks ago , often taking an oxygen tank onto the bandstand . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Jones , a fixture of the Coltrane group from late 1960 to early 1966 and for more than three decades the leader of several noteworthy groups of his own , was the first great post-bebop percussionist . <br><blue>6</blue>Building on the innovations of the jazz modernists Kenny Clarke and Max Roach , who liberated the drum kit from a purely time-keeping function in the 1940 's , he paved the way for a later generation of drummers who dispensed with a steady rhythmic pulse altogether in the interest of greater improvisational freedom . <br><blue>7</blue>But he never lost that pulse : the beat was always palpable when he played , even as he embellished it with layer upon layer of interlocking polyrhythms . <br><blue>8</blue>The critic and historian Leonard Feather explained Mr. Jones 's significance this way : '' His main achievement was the creation of what might be called a circle of sound , a continuum in which no beat of the bar was necessarily indicated by any specific accent , yet the overall feeling became a tremendously dynamic and rhythmically important part of the whole group . '' <br><blue>9</blue>But if the self-taught Mr. Jones had a profound influence on other drummers , not many of them directly emulated his style , at least in part because few had the stamina for it . <br><blue>10</blue>None of the images that the critics invoked to describe his playing -- volcano , thunderstorm , perpetual-motion machine -- quite did justice to the strength of his attack , the complexity of his ideas or the originality of his approach . <br><blue>11</blue>Elvin Ray Jones was born in Pontiac , Mich. , on Sept. 9 , 1927 . <br><blue>12</blue>The youngest of 10 children , he was the third Jones brother to become a professional musician , following Hank , a respected jazz pianist who is still active , and Thad , a cornetist , composer , arranger and bandleader , who died in 1986 . <br><blue>13</blue>He began teaching himself to play drums at 13 , but he had lost his heart to the instrument long before then . '' <br><blue>14</blue>I never wanted to play anything else since I was 2 , '' he told one interviewer . '' <br><blue>15</blue>I would get these wooden spoons from my mother and beat on the pots and pans in the kitchen . '' <br><blue>16</blue>After spending three years in the Army he joined his brothers as a fixture on the busy Detroit jazz scene of the early 1950 's . <br><blue>17</blue>As the house drummer at a local nightclub , the Bluebird Inn , he worked with local musicians like Tommy Flanagan and Kenny Burrell as well as visiting jazz stars like Charlie Parker and Miles Davis . <br><blue>18</blue>In 1956 after briefly touring with the bassist Charles Mingus and the pianist Bud Powell , Mr. Jones moved to New York , where he was soon in great demand as an accompanist . <br><blue>19</blue>He occasionally sat in with Miles Davis , and he later recalled that Coltrane , who was then Davis 's saxophonist , promised to hire Mr. Jones whenever he formed his own group . <br><blue>20</blue>In the fall of 1960 Coltrane made good on that promise . <br><hr><br><blue>1(36)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (6_30) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Jones 's</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>Elvin Jones , whose explosive drumming powered the John Coltrane Quartet , the most influential and controversial jazz ensemble of the 1960 's</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_10) 	<m_str>the self-taught Mr. Jones</m_str> (9_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_21) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Jones 's</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>Elvin Ray Jones</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Jones</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Jones</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_28) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_34) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_40) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Jones 's</m_str> (3_33) 	<m_str>Jones</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Jones whenever he formed his own group</m_str> (19_26) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_29) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_31) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_15) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_14) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Manhattan</m_str> (1_28) 	<br><blue>3(1)</blue>: <m_str>the bassist Charles Mingus</m_str> (18_7) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (9_34) 	<m_str>his style , at least</m_str> (9_21) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (14_9) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (14_1) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the beat</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (7_21) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>other drummers</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (9_18) 	<br><blue>8(4)</blue>: <m_str>Coltrane , who was then Davis 's saxophonist</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>Miles Davis</m_str> (17_35) 	<m_str>Davis 's</m_str> (19_19) 	<m_str>with Miles Davis</m_str> (19_5) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>Coltrane</m_str> (20_6) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>his own group</m_str> (19_31) 	<m_str>the whole group</m_str> (8_62) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
