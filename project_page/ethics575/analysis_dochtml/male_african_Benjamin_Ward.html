<blue>1</blue>Benjamin Ward , who began his career as a traffic officer in white gloves on First Avenue , moved through a succession of state and city law-enforcement posts and eventually became the first black commissioner of the New York City Police Department , died yesterday at a Queens hospital . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 75 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Ward was taken unconscious to New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens on Friday evening , said Sgt. Michael Wyskowski , a Police Department spokesman . <br><blue>4</blue>He suffered from asthma most of his life . <br><blue>5</blue>Mr. Ward , whose booming voice and strong sense of self made him seem even taller than his 6 feet 1 inch , was a lifelong study in focused ambition . <br><blue>6</blue>The son of a cleaning woman , he earned degree after degree while working at full-time jobs . <br><blue>7</blue>He served as city traffic commissioner , as corrections commissioner for both state and city , and as chief of the city housing police before becoming New York 's top police official . <br><blue>8</blue>In more than five years as police commissioner , from 1983 to 1989 , he commanded the city 's war against the scourge of crack and the addicts desperately in need of money for their habit . <br><blue>9</blue>It was a wild period of heightened crime , when many people put signs on their parked cars declaring no radio was inside . '' <br><blue>10</blue>He was operating with very , very limited resources , and he was able to reassure the public that the Police Department was in control , '' said Robert McGuire , who served as police commissioner from 1978 to 1983 . <br><blue>11</blue>Along the way , Mr. Ward achieved national visibility by becoming one of the nation 's first promoters of community policing in which officers add an element of social work to their presence on the beat . <br><blue>12</blue>As commissioner , Mr. Ward held a post occupied for decades by men of Irish descent . <br><blue>13</blue>He had faced discrimination within the department , but he also found himself facing more politically risky race issues citywide . <br><blue>14</blue>In one such incident in the Bronx , in 1984 , a police officer shot and killed a 66-year-old black woman , Eleanor Bumpurs , who was resisting eviction for nonpayment of rent . <br><blue>15</blue>Mr. Ward defended the officer for following the laws and guidelines on use of force , but could not help remarking that the slain woman reminded him of his mother . '' <br><blue>16</blue>I would not have killed that woman , '' he said in his farewell address in 1989 . <br><blue>17</blue>In a news conference after his appointment five years earlier , he described his philosophical and moral compass : '' Many people make the mistake of thinking that black people are liberal because they are black . <br><blue>18</blue>I 'm very , very liberal when it comes to race relations , but when it comes to law enforcement , I am very , very conservative . <br><blue>19</blue>I certainly believe bad guys belong in jail . '' <br><blue>20</blue>He often said that his ambition was to be a '' cop 's cop , '' and he carried a 9-millimeter semiautomatic Glock 17 , a gun banned by the Police Department . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>a 66-year-old black woman , Eleanor Bumpurs , who was resisting eviction for nonpayment of rent</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>the slain woman</m_str> (15_23) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the addicts</m_str> (8_27) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (8_35) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>It</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>the city 's war</m_str> (8_17) 	<br><blue>4(28)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Ward</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_27) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_29) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_13) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Ward</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_5) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (5_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_15) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Ward</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Ward</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (13_13) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>many people</m_str> (9_11) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (9_16) 	<br><blue>6(4)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (18_22) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the New York City Police Department</m_str> (1_37) 	<m_str>Police Department</m_str> (3_24) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>New York 's</m_str> (7_27) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (17_34) 	<m_str>black people</m_str> (17_29) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>officers</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (11_32) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (18_8) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>city</m_str> (7_15) 	<m_str>the city 's</m_str> (8_17) 	<br><blue>13(1)</blue>: <m_str>the beat</m_str> (11_35) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Bronx</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>the nation 's</m_str> (11_14) 	<br><blue>15(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Police Department</m_str> (10_20) 	<m_str>the department</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>the Police Department</m_str> (20_30) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
