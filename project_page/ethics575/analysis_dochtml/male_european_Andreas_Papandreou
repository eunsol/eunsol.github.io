<blue>1</blue>Andreas Papandreou , the former Prime Minister of Greece and a maverick who towered over Greek political life for more than two decades , died yesterday in Athens . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 77 . <br><blue>3</blue>His symptoms " were compatible with a heart attack , which finally caused his death at 2:30 A.M. , " his doctors said in a statement . <br><blue>4</blue>Open heart surgery in 1988 had left Mr. Papandreou weakened , although it did not stop him from entering and winning elections for the third time in 1993 . <br><blue>5</blue>But during 1995 , his failing health prevented him from performing the normal duties of Government , leaving Greece flailing . <br><blue>6</blue>He worked at home for just a few hours a day and rarely appeared in public . <br><blue>7</blue>Yet even as his fiery voice , which could mesmerize the nation , had thinned to a near whisper and he walked with great difficulty , Mr. Papandreou refused to step aside or name a deputy to run the Government . <br><blue>8</blue>Finally , in January , his Socialist Party named Costas Simitis as Prime Minister , and Mr. Papandreou had not been seen in public since his release from a hospital on March 21 after a four-month stay . <br><blue>9</blue>Few other politicians in modern Greece have inspired as much love and loathing at home and as much bewilderment and irritation abroad . <br><blue>10</blue>The tall figure with bushy eyebrows fascinated Greeks with his compelling oratory and his unpredictable and volatile ways , and even though he became as familiar as a close relative , he remained hard to fathom even for his friends . <br><blue>11</blue>He was successful at home because he appealed to Greece 's thirst for change , and his nationalist polemics appealed to the Greeks ' perennial feeling of being misunderstood and unappreciated . <br><blue>12</blue>Maverick Stances Angered His Allies Abroad , Greece 's Western allies were befuddled or exasperated as the undoctrinaire Socialist took positions diametrically opposed to theirs , on issues ranging from Serbian aggression in Bosnia to the role of NATO in the Mediterranean . <br><blue>13</blue>Above all , the United States loomed large in his life , for that was the country where he had served in the Navy , graduated from college , worked , married twice and had four children ; it was his source of financing and the nation that he first admired and later railed against . <br><blue>14</blue>The core of his foreign policy was to end Greece 's status as " a client state of the West . " <br><blue>15</blue>As a result , he refused to condemn the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan , campaigned against American military bases in Greece and variously threatened to pull out of NATO , the United Nations and the European Union , although he accepted the Union 's generous funds . <br><blue>16</blue>He blocked European credits for Turkey , Greece 's enemy . <br><blue>17</blue>While others shunned Libya and Yugoslavia , he improved his ties there . <br><blue>18</blue>In the Bosnian war he supported Serbia , a neighbor and longtime ally , and opposed international sanctions against Serbia . <br><blue>19</blue>He was reluctant to condemn Serbian atrocities , even in the face of ample evidence . <br><blue>20</blue>Mr. Papandreou thrived on being contrary . <br><hr><br><blue>1(8)</blue>: <m_str>Greece 's</m_str> (11_10) 	<m_str>Greece</m_str> (5_19) 	<m_str>Greece 's</m_str> (12_8) 	<m_str>Greece</m_str> (15_21) 	<m_str>Turkey , Greece 's enemy</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>Greece 's</m_str> (14_10) 	<m_str>Greece 's</m_str> (16_8) 	<m_str>Greece</m_str> (1_9) 	<br><blue>2(17)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_21) 	<m_str>Mr. Papandreou</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (4_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Papandreou</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_21) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Papandreou</m_str> (7_27) 	<m_str>Costas Simitis</m_str> (8_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Papandreou</m_str> (8_17) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_26) 	<br><blue>3(9)</blue>: <m_str>His</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_39) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_32) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_17) 	<br><blue>4(12)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (13_19) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_41) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_40) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_49) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>His Allies Abroad</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>Greece 's Western allies</m_str> (12_8) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>Serbia , a neighbor and longtime ally , and opposed international sanctions against Serbia</m_str> (18_7) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Government</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>the Government</m_str> (7_39) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the nation</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>the nation</m_str> (13_46) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>his nationalist polemics</m_str> (11_17) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (13_4) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
