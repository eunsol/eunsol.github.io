<blue>1</blue>Wellington Mara , the patriarch of the National Football League , who served as a ball boy for the leather-helmeted 1925 Giants and later turned the team -- founded by his father -- into one of the marquee names in professional sports , died yesterday at his home in Rye , N.Y . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 89 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer of the lymph nodes , the Giants said . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Mara had a front-row seat in the world of pro sports going back to the afternoon of Oct. 18 , 1925 , when the Giants played their first home game , losing to the Frankford Yellow Jackets . <br><blue>5</blue>He witnessed the famed Sneakers Game , when the Giants outmaneuvered the Chicago Bears by wearing rubber-soled footgear in the 1934 championship game on a frozen Polo Grounds field . <br><blue>6</blue>After 31 seasons at the Polo Grounds , Mr. Mara took the Giants to Yankee Stadium in 1956 , and they became the glamour franchise of the N.F.L. , winning the league championship that season and playing in the title game five times in the next seven years . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. Mara moved the Giants again , to the New Jersey Meadowlands , in 1976 , despite an outcry led by the city 's mayor at the time , John V. Lindsay , when the plans were announced several years earlier . <br><blue>8</blue>The Giants went to the Super Bowl three times after that , winning it twice , and their games at the 76,000-seat Giants Stadium are invariably sellouts . <br><blue>9</blue>Through the decades , Mr. Mara remained an owner who was also a gentleman of the old school , a serious businessman and a serious fan maintaining a careful reserve in contrast to more voluble or explosive sports executives . <br><blue>10</blue>At Giants road games , he often sat in the press box , watching quietly , expressing his thoughts in a low voice , projecting the aura of a man who had been through countless triumphs and travails and could take them all in stride . <br><blue>11</blue>A fixture at practices , always low-key and polite , Mr. Mara was also a man who appreciated coaches of the old school . <br><blue>12</blue>Bill Parcells , a disciplinarian , was one of his favorites . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Mara assembled the fabled Giants teams of the 1950 's and 60 's ; they included Frank Gifford , Kyle Rote , Y.A. Tittle , Sam Huff , Andy Robustelli , Roosevelt Brown and Roosevelt Grier . <br><blue>14</blue>And he helped fuel the immense prosperity that all the N.F.L. franchises enjoy by championing a formula in which all the teams share equally in national television broadcast revenue . <br><blue>15</blue>He devoted his life to his large family , his Catholic faith and his extended Giants family , whose members revered him for his integrity and kindness . '' <br><blue>16</blue>One of the things I miss the most this year is seeing him at every practice , sitting on that golf chair he always had , '' Giants running back Tiki Barber said . '' <br><blue>17</blue>After games , you 'd walk into the locker room and he 'd be standing right there to shake your hand , win or lose . <br><blue>18</blue>He was such a dignified and in some ways regal character who always respected the game and respected what this league is about . '' <br><blue>19</blue>Two Generations in Hall Tim Mara , the Giants ' founder , who died in 1959 , was a charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame . <br><blue>20</blue>Wellington Mara , the Giants ' president and co-chief executive officer , was elected to the Hall in 1997 as the Maras became the first father and son to be inducted . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>the N.F.L.</m_str> (6_27) 	<br><blue>2(26)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_31) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_47) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Mara</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Mara</m_str> (6_9) 	<m_str>Mr. Mara</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Mara</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Mara</m_str> (11_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Mara</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_10) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_14) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (15_22) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_24) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (16_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_23) 	<m_str>Tiki Barber</m_str> (16_31) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_12) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Tim Mara</m_str> (19_5) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>you</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>your</m_str> (17_20) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the 1934 championship game on a frozen Polo Grounds field</m_str> (5_20) 	<m_str>the title game</m_str> (6_39) 	<br><blue>5(17)</blue>: <m_str>the leather-helmeted 1925 Giants</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>the Giants</m_str> (3_10) 	<m_str>the Giants</m_str> (4_25) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (4_28) 	<m_str>the Giants</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>the Giants</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>the city 's</m_str> (7_22) 	<m_str>the Giants</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>The Giants</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>Giants</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>the fabled Giants</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>Giants</m_str> (15_16) 	<m_str>Giants</m_str> (16_28) 	<m_str>the Giants '</m_str> (19_8) 	<m_str>the Giants '</m_str> (20_4) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>this league</m_str> (18_20) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the old school</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>the old school</m_str> (11_21) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>Bill Parcells , a disciplinarian</m_str> (12_1) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
