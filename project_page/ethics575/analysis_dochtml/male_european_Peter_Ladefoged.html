<blue>1</blue>Peter Ladefoged , an internationally renowned linguist who spent his life blissfully awash in the whistles , murmurs , pops , clicks and trills that make up the world 's spoken languages , died on Jan. 24 in London . <br><blue>2</blue>Professor Ladefoged , who was returning to his home in Aliso Viejo , Calif. , from fieldwork in India , was 80 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was a stroke , said a spokesman for the University of California at Los Angeles , where he was distinguished professor emeritus of phonetics . <br><blue>4</blue>Professor Ladefoged was widely regarded as the world 's foremost phonetician , a scholar who studies the acoustics and physiology of speech -- the precise interplay of tongue , lung and larynx that creates the inventory of noises we use in the everyday business of talking . <br><blue>5</blue>His job recalled that of a modern-day Henry Higgins , and in fact , Professor Ladefoged , who was born in England and to the end of his life retained its plummy tones , was the resident phonetics expert on the set of the movie version of '' My Fair Lady , '' released in 1964 . <br><blue>6</blue>In more scholarly work , he made significant contributions to forensic phonetics , the science of speech as used by the police and in courts of law . <br><blue>7</blue>( His work included studies demonstrating the unreliability of voice identification by ear alone . ) <br><blue>8</blue>He also documented endangered languages around the world . <br><blue>9</blue>Professor Ladefoged was known in particular for his widely used textbook '' A Course in Phonetics '' ( Thomson/Wadsworth ) , published in its fifth edition this year . <br><blue>10</blue>With Ian Maddieson , he wrote '' The Sounds of the World 's Languages '' ( Blackwell , 1996 ) , considered the definitive catalog of the consonants and vowels of the world 's 6,000 tongues . <br><blue>11</blue>His family name , Danish in origin , is pronounced '' LAD-uh-foe-gid . '' <br><blue>12</blue>Language is a symbolic code , designed to convey meaning from one human mind to another . <br><blue>13</blue>In spoken language , the code is realized as sound waves , produced when air is forced from a speaker 's lungs past the vocal cords and out of the mouth . <br><blue>14</blue>The ear converts these vibrations into electrical impulses , which are relayed to the speech-processing centers of the brain . <br><blue>15</blue>These little disturbances of air were Professor Ladefoged 's lifework . <br><blue>16</blue>How many speech sounds , he wondered , are humanly possible ? <br><blue>17</blue>What parts of the anatomy -- tongue , teeth , lips and hard and soft palates -- can be used to make them ? <br><blue>18</blue>Which noises are deployed as linguistic code in a particular language , which are not , and what accounts for the difference ? <br><blue>19</blue>Armed with tape recorder , oscilloscope and equipment for measuring air flow , he traveled to remote villages around the globe , recording what he found there in all its noisy variety . <br><blue>20</blue>He liked to paint speakers ' palates with a concoction of olive oil and powdered charcoal , which let him photograph the precise spot at which the tongue made contact with the roof of the mouth ( thereby wiping away some charcoal ) as a particular sound was made . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the mouth</m_str> (20_35) 	<m_str>the mouth</m_str> (13_30) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (1_39) 	<br><blue>3(21)</blue>: <m_str>Professor Ladefoged</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_20) 	<m_str>Professor Ladefoged 's</m_str> (15_7) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_10) 	<m_str>Professor Ladefoged</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>Professor Ladefoged , who was returning to his home in Aliso Viejo , Calif. , from fieldwork in India</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Professor Ladefoged , who was born in England and to the end of his life retained its plummy tones</m_str> (5_15) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (20_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (2_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_28) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>more scholarly work</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>His work</m_str> (7_2) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>the world</m_str> (8_7) 	<m_str>the world 's</m_str> (10_32) 	<m_str>the world 's</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>the world 's</m_str> (1_28) 	<br><blue>6(4)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (9_24) 	<m_str>his life</m_str> (5_28) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (5_31) 	<m_str>his life</m_str> (1_10) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>India</m_str> (2_19) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
