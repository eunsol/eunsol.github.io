<blue>1</blue>Jan Tinbergen , the Dutch economist and Nobel laureate whose technical accomplishments and passion for effective public policy have led some to compare him with John Maynard Keynes , died last Thursday at the age of 91 . <br><blue>2</blue>News of his death was withheld by his family until yesterday to allow his funeral to take place without publicity . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Tinbergen was trained as a physicist ( he received a doctoral degree in the subject from the University of Leyden ) but switched to economics in the late 1920 's . <br><blue>4</blue>During the early 1930 's he was a professor of development planning at the University of Rotterdam and staff member of the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics , where he applied mathematical techniques from the sciences to the question of why industrial output fluctuated in nonrandom ways -- the classic puzzle of the business cycle . <br><blue>5</blue>As an adviser to the Social Democrats in the Netherlands , he was co-author of a plan for coping with the unemployment that had swept across Europe with the Great Depression . <br><blue>6</blue>Econometric Models But Mr. Tinbergen first gained prominence with his pioneering efforts to build mathematical models of how whole economies work -- more specifically , how shocks like harvest failures or stock market crashes ricochet through an economy to influence employment , output and inflation . <br><blue>7</blue>Others had used mathematics to add intellectual rigor to economic theory . <br><blue>8</blue>But in the view of Paul Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , " Tinbergen 's combination of analytic versatility and good policy judgment " gave him an enormous advantage over most of his contemporaries . <br><blue>9</blue>His model of the American economy , produced for the League of Nations in 1938 , was the precursor of the giant computer models now used to forecast everything from the size of next year 's budget deficit to the exchange rate of the Mexican peso . <br><blue>10</blue>In the decade after World War II he served as the director of the Dutch Central Planning Bureau and as a key policy adviser to the country 's Social Democrats . <br><blue>11</blue>Indeed , his reputation as a guru of the democratic left was reportedly so sacrosanct that he was able to broker a wage pact between the Government and the country 's militant labor unions that prevented mounting inflation . <br><blue>12</blue>But he remained a world-class theorist and practitioner as well , helping to transform economics into a true policy science . <br><blue>13</blue>One idea generally attributed to Mr. Tinbergen is that governments must have at least as many independent policy instruments as policy targets . <br><blue>14</blue>For example , if a country wishes to control both the exchange rate of its currency and the rate of economic growth it must use a minimum of two levers -- say , the supply of money and the rate of deficit spending . <br><blue>15</blue>That notion comes as second nature to the current generation of economists , who were put through their mathematical paces in graduate school . <br><blue>16</blue>But it was a revelation at the time , an insight that had eluded the greats . <br><blue>17</blue>In 1969 Mr. Tinbergen shared the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science with the Norwegian Ragnar Frisch . <br><blue>18</blue>And while his intellectual force as an economist was by this time largely spent , he remained , in the words of James Tobin of Yale , " a congenital do-gooder , " who used his fame and prestige to further the cause of rational economic policy in the third world . <br><blue>19</blue>Failure to help impoverished countries , he told an interviewer during his tenure as the chairman of the United Nations Development Planning Committee , would result in " mass unemployment , increasing internal conflicts , disaster . " <br><blue>20</blue>Part of his prescription was a sharp increase in development aid , a fashionable view at the time . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>his family</m_str> (2_8) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>Paul Samuelson of the Massachusetts</m_str> (8_6) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (15_18) 	<m_str>economists , who were put through their mathematical paces in graduate school</m_str> (15_12) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>a country</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_23) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (14_15) 	<br><blue>5(26)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_17) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_36) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_3) 	<m_str>Tinbergen 's</m_str> (8_16) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_30) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (8_28) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (2_3) 	<m_str>Mr. Tinbergen</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (1_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (2_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Tinbergen first</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_35) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (2_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Tinbergen</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_3) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>an economist</m_str> (18_7) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the University of Rotterdam</m_str> (4_14) 	<m_str>the University of Leyden</m_str> (3_18) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>That notion</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (16_2) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>the third world</m_str> (18_49) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the country 's</m_str> (10_26) 	<m_str>the country 's</m_str> (11_29) 	<br><blue>11(1)</blue>: <m_str>his death</m_str> (2_3) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
