<blue>1</blue>Ian Hamilton Finlay , a Scottish poet and conceptual artist known for his neo-Classical-style sculptures inscribed with poetic texts as well as for his home and garden , an imaginative echo of ancient Rome in the Pentland Hills of Lanarkshire , died on Monday at a hospital in Edinburgh . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 80 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , said Katherine Chan , director of the Nolan/Eckman Gallery , which represents Mr. Finlay in New York . <br><blue>4</blue>The famously contentious Mr. Finlay began calling his home Little Sparta in 1980 , partly to symbolize his refusal to compromise with the local authorities over whether a building dedicated to Apollo should be taxed as a religious or a commercial structure . <br><blue>5</blue>Now maintained by a foundation , Little Sparta resembles the home of an ancient Roman philosopher-poet . <br><blue>6</blue>Rustic and Classical-style stone carvings bearing literary quotations have been carefully placed throughout the property . <br><blue>7</blue>One stone block , seemingly antique and tilted in the ground as if it were a ruin , presents the neatly chiseled words of the French revolutionary Louis de Saint-Just : '' The world has been empty since the Romans . '' <br><blue>8</blue>But the grounds are not completely given over to nostalgic traditionalism . <br><blue>9</blue>Images of 20th-century warfare are also distributed about . <br><blue>10</blue>The two posts of a stone-and-brick gateway , for example , are each topped by an oversize stone carving of a hand grenade . <br><blue>11</blue>Mr. Finlay conceived and designed his sculptures , but hired craftsmen to produce them . <br><blue>12</blue>He also created works for exhibitions in Europe and the United States and for public commissions . <br><blue>13</blue>Although he had agoraphobia , which restricted his traveling , he had an internationally recognized career , and many visitors made the pilgrimage to Little Sparta . <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Finlay was on the short list for Britain 's Turner Prize for contemporary art in 1985 and received the honorary appointment of a Commander of the British Empire in 2002 . <br><blue>15</blue>His work was selected to be part of the 2006 Tate Triennial , a survey of British contemporary art now on view at Tate Britain in London . <br><blue>16</blue>Ian Hamilton Finlay was born on Oct. 28 , 1925 , in Nassau , the Bahamas , where his father was a bootlegger who smuggled rum into the United States during Prohibition . <br><blue>17</blue>At 6 Mr. Finlay was sent to boarding school in Scotland . <br><blue>18</blue>War cut short his education at 13 , when he was evacuated to Orkney , an archipelago at the northern tip of Scotland . <br><blue>19</blue>As a teenager he briefly attended the Glasgow School of Art before being called up in 1942 for duty with the Royal Army Service Corps . <br><blue>20</blue>After the war , Mr. Finlay worked as a shepherd while producing paintings ; short plays , which were broadcast by the BBC ; and stories , which were published in The Herald of Glasgow . <br><hr><br><blue>1(23)</blue>: <m_str>His</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Finlay in New York</m_str> (3_18) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_4) 	<m_str>The famously contentious Mr. Finlay</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>Ian Hamilton Finlay</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_18) 	<m_str>a Scottish poet</m_str> (1_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Finlay</m_str> (20_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Finlay</m_str> (17_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_24) 	<m_str>Mr. Finlay</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Finlay</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>his neo-Classical-style sculptures inscribed with poetic texts as well as for his home and garden</m_str> (1_13) 	<m_str>his sculptures</m_str> (11_6) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (11_14) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Little Sparta</m_str> (5_7) 	<m_str>Little Sparta in 1980</m_str> (4_10) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (14_9) 	<m_str>Tate Britain in London</m_str> (15_24) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Edinburgh</m_str> (1_49) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>War</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>the war</m_str> (20_2) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>the United States</m_str> (16_28) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>Rustic and Classical-style stone carvings bearing literary quotations</m_str> (6_1) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Scotland</m_str> (18_23) 	<m_str>Scotland</m_str> (17_11) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>his home</m_str> (1_24) 	<m_str>his home</m_str> (4_8) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
