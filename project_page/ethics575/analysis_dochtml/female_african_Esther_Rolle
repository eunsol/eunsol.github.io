<blue>1</blue>Esther Rolle , a pioneering African-American actress who gained national recognition in the 1970 's for her role as Florida Evans on two television shows , first '' Maude '' and then '' Good Times , '' died at a hospital here on Tuesday . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 78 and lived in Los Angeles . <br><blue>3</blue>Larry Calhoun , her longtime publicist , said the cause of death had not been determined , but he added that Ms. Rolle had been suffering from diabetes and had been under dialysis . <br><blue>4</blue>He said she had celebrated her 78th birthday a little more than a week ago , and that one of the last things she had done was to write a check to support a local black theater , something she had done most of her career . <br><blue>5</blue>Ms. Rolle met with many of her old friends and cast members of the two television shows just last week in a gathering here for a People magazine article . <br><blue>6</blue>Norman Lear , one of the executive producers of both of her shows , said the once-stocky actress appeared thin but vibrant , and that she had a role in a forthcoming movie , '' Down in the Delta , '' directed by the poet Maya Angelou and scheduled for release this month . <br><blue>7</blue>Ms. Rolle became famous for playing the role of a strong-willed maid on television , and in that role she also performed memorably in the play '' A Raisin in the Sun , '' in the television movie '' Summer of My German Soldier , '' for which she won an Emmy award in 1979 , and in the movie '' Driving Miss Daisy . '' <br><blue>8</blue>She also appeared in the film '' Rosewood . '' <br><blue>9</blue>But she spoke firmly and often about about her desire to fight black stereotypes on television and even left the cast of '' Good Times '' for a while , saying at the time that she resented the image presented by the buffoonish character of her son in the show . <br><blue>10</blue>In the show she played the matriarch of a struggling black family in Chicago . <br><blue>11</blue>Ms. Rolle was well known for her strong personality , both on and off screen , and her ear for the nuances of race relations . <br><blue>12</blue>Mr. Lear , who was the executive producer of '' All in the Family , '' from which '' Maude '' and '' Good Times '' were later spun off , said one of his most vivid memories of Ms. Rolle was a musical number she performed with Beatrice Arthur , the actress who played Maude . <br><blue>13</blue>Mr. Lear said that every year there was a musical number on the show , and one season Ms. Rolle and Ms. Arthur performed '' Me and My Shadow . '' <br><blue>14</blue>Ms. Arthur kept trying to stand in back and play the shadow in the scene , but Ms. Rolle kept slipping behind her , a striking metaphor for the subtleties of race relations that Mr. Lear described as '' an indelible memory of an indelible woman . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Ms. Rolle was born in Pompano Beach , Fla. , a retirement community that was once a bucolic farming town with the character of the deep South . <br><blue>16</blue>She was the 10th of 18 children and her father was a farmer . <br><blue>17</blue>She had a theatrical bent and after high school followed her sister , Rosanna Carter , also an actress , to New York . <br><blue>18</blue>She was one of the early members of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York and in the late 1950 's performed with Shologa Oloba , an African-American dance troupe . <br><blue>19</blue>In 1958 she and her sister appeared with the company in a revival of Asadata Dafora 's '' Zunguru . '' <br><blue>20</blue>In 1990 she became the first woman to receive the N.A.A.C.P. Chairman 's Civil Rights Leadership Award for her work improving the image of blacks . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>: <m_str>Ms. Arthur</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Arthur</m_str> (13_22) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (14_23) 	<m_str>Beatrice Arthur , the actress who played Maude</m_str> (12_49) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the movie</m_str> (7_59) 	<m_str>a forthcoming movie</m_str> (6_31) 	<br><blue>3(43)</blue>: <m_str>she</m_str> (6_26) 	<m_str>Ms. Rolle</m_str> (14_18) 	<m_str>Ms. Rolle</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>Maude</m_str> (12_56) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_46) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Rolle</m_str> (3_22) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_20) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_18) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Esther Rolle , a pioneering African-American actress who gained national recognition in the 1970 's for her role as Florida Evans on two television shows , first '' Maude '' and then '' Good Times , '' died at a hospital here on Tuesday</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Rolle</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_9) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>the first woman</m_str> (20_5) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_24) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_7) 	<m_str>My</m_str> (7_42) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_17) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_19) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (7_49) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_40) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (17_11) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (4_45) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>Ms. Rolle</m_str> (12_40) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_4) 	<m_str>the once-stocky actress</m_str> (6_16) 	<m_str>Ms. Rolle</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_46) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_36) 	<m_str>Ms. Rolle</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Lear</m_str> (14_35) 	<m_str>Mr. Lear</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>the show</m_str> (9_49) 	<m_str>the show</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>the show</m_str> (10_2) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>her role</m_str> (1_17) 	<m_str>that role</m_str> (7_18) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>her sister</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>her sister , Rosanna Carter , also an actress , to New York</m_str> (17_11) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>Me</m_str> (13_26) 	<m_str>My</m_str> (13_28) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_19) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the buffoonish character of her son in the show</m_str> (9_42) 	<m_str>the character of the deep South</m_str> (15_22) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
