<blue>1</blue>Stanley Turrentine , a jazz tenor saxophonist whose blues-based , easygoing style appealed to a market wider than the jazz world for 40 years , died on Tuesday at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 66 and lived in Fort Washington , Md . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was a stroke , said Robin Burgess , his agent . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Turrentine collapsed in his hotel room on Sunday before finishing a six-night run at the Blue Note . <br><blue>5</blue>Though he was not a schooled musician , Mr. Turrentine had the essence of blues and gospel playing ; there was a lithe sensuousness in his sound . <br><blue>6</blue>His early influences were Coleman Hawkins and Don Byas , and like them he had a broad tone . <br><blue>7</blue>But he was not a cathartic or harmonically complex player ; he broke up his improvisations with subtle cries and sighs and made his improvisations easy to follow . <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Turrentine was born in Pittsburgh . <br><blue>9</blue>His father was a part-time jazz musician who had performed with Al Cooper 's Savoy Sultans and his mother played church piano . <br><blue>10</blue>His elder brother , Tommy , became a trumpeter . <br><blue>11</blue>After taking up the saxophone at the age of 11 , he began his career as a teenager , touring for two years with Lowell Fulson 's group , a band that also included Ray Charles on piano . <br><blue>12</blue>He moved to Cleveland and worked with Tadd Dameron . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1953 he replaced John Coltrane in the saxophonist Earl Bostic 's group . <br><blue>14</blue>He entered the Army in 1956 and played in the 158th Army Band , which he said was the only formal schooling in music he ever had . <br><blue>15</blue>At the end of the 1950 's he worked with the Max Roach Quintet alongside his brother . <br><blue>16</blue>He began his affiliation with Blue Note records in 1960 , making his own first album , '' Look Out ! <br><blue>17</blue>, '' after appearing as a sideman on records by the Blue Note artists Dizzy Reece and Jimmy Smith . <br><blue>18</blue>With Blue Note , he would become one of the top figures in the field that became known as soul-jazz , unpretentious working-class music that usually featured a tenor saxophonist and an organ and that had a circuit of small clubs in black neighborhoods across the country . <br><blue>19</blue>In the 1960 's he was married for a time to the organist Shirley Scott . <br><blue>20</blue>They appeared on each other 's albums , which became increasingly commercial and exposed the artists to rock and soul audiences . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>the saxophonist Earl Bostic 's group</m_str> (13_8) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Army</m_str> (14_3) 	<m_str>the 158th Army Band , which he said was the only formal schooling in music he ever had</m_str> (14_10) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>His early influences</m_str> (6_1) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Blue Note</m_str> (16_6) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Al Cooper 's Savoy Sultans</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>his mother</m_str> (9_18) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>his improvisations</m_str> (7_24) 	<m_str>his improvisations with subtle cries and sighs</m_str> (7_15) 	<br><blue>7(33)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Turrentine</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_25) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Turrentine</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>the Max Roach Quintet</m_str> (15_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>His father</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_13) 	<m_str>Mr. Turrentine</m_str> (5_9) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_18) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_26) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_16) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>his brother</m_str> (15_16) 	<m_str>His elder brother , Tommy</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>Blue</m_str> (18_2) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
