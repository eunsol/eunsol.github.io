<blue>1</blue>Wilfred Thesiger , who was among the last of the great explorers lucky enough to have lived when the globe still had some uncharted corners , died on Sunday in England . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 93 and had been living in a retirement home in Coulsdon , Surrey . <br><blue>3</blue>Sir Wilfred was an insatiable traveler throughout his long life . <br><blue>4</blue>He was also a man of private wealth and a romantic who seemed to hate the modern world and found nobility in privation . <br><blue>5</blue>He was the first foreigner to cross the Empty Quarter of Saudi Arabia twice , once in 1946 and again in 1948 , when that vast desert was one of the last unmapped regions of the earth . <br><blue>6</blue>He became the first outsider to see the quicksands at Umm as-Samim . '' <br><blue>7</blue>Arabian Sands , '' his account of those travels , first published in 1959 , became an international best seller . <br><blue>8</blue>It was also a declaration of love for the Bedouin Arabs , whose harsh way of life he had shared . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Here in the desert I had found all that I asked : I knew that I should never find it again , '' he wrote . <br><blue>10</blue>Sir Wilfred 's books , often illustrated with his own photographs , were poetic and autobiographical in their approach , describing journeys as much into himself as into the world . <br><blue>11</blue>Reviewing '' Arabian Sands '' for The New York Times , the British writer and critic Peter Quennel wrote that strictly speaking , Sir Wilfred discovered almost nothing on this journey . <br><blue>12</blue>Even the mountains he traversed were shifting sand : '' We were faced '' Sir Wilfred wrote in his account of the closing stages of the march , '' by a range as high as , perhaps even higher than the range we had crossed the day before , but here the peaks were steeper and more pronounced , rising in many cases to great pinnacles , down which the flowing ridges swept like draperies . <br><blue>13</blue>These sands , paler colored than those we had crossed , were very soft , cascading round our feet as the camels struggled up the slopes . '' <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Quennel noted that this trip , like all of Sir Wilfred 's , seemed to have been '' a journey in search of himself , in quest of self-realization and self-fulfillment . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Sir Wilfred , he said , belonged to a class of English writer whose '' sense of poetry is apt to reach the surface when their footsteps strike a desert track . '' <br><blue>16</blue>His second book , '' Marsh Arabs , '' which appeared in 1964 , told of the seven years he spent , from 1951 to 1958 , among the Madan Arabs of the vast marshlands at the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers in southern Iraq . <br><blue>17</blue>In earlier journeys , he had explored , at great risk , the Danakil country of the Afars of northern Ethiopia and discovered why the great Awash river , which traverses their lands , never reaches the sea . <br><blue>18</blue>But in later life he watched disillusioned as the modern world caught up with the peoples he admired ; as oil rigs and pipelines spread across the Empty Quarter and the Bedouin turned in their camels for Toyota Land Cruisers ; as President Saddam Hussein drained the Iraqi marshes to clear out rebels . <br><blue>19</blue>Although he spent the last part of his life in his native England , he made his later decades a personal act of rebellion against modernity , setting up home among the Samburu tribesmen of northern Kenya in Maralal , a desert shanty town . <br><blue>20</blue>But he never learned their language , as he had learned Arabic , preferring instead to teach them English , even though this introduced them to the modern age he disdained . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Arabian Sands</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Arabian Sands</m_str> (11_3) 	<br><blue>2(36)</blue>: <m_str>Sir Wilfred</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (14_25) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>Sir Wilfred 's</m_str> (10_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_9) 	<m_str>Sir Wilfred</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_8) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (10_26) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>the British writer</m_str> (11_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_8) 	<m_str>critic Peter Quennel</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_15) 	<m_str>Sir Wilfred</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>Sir Wilfred wrote in his account of the closing stages of the march</m_str> (12_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_9) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Quennel</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_30) 	<m_str>Sir Wilfred 's</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_5) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (17_32) 	<m_str>the Madan Arabs of the vast marshlands at the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers in southern Iraq</m_str> (16_29) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Empty Quarter of Saudi Arabia twice , once in 1946 and again</m_str> (5_8) 	<m_str>the Empty Quarter</m_str> (18_27) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Bedouin</m_str> (18_31) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (18_35) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the camels</m_str> (13_21) 	<m_str>their camels</m_str> (18_35) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>southern Iraq</m_str> (16_47) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>Saudi Arabia</m_str> (5_12) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>1946</m_str> (5_18) 	<m_str>the earth</m_str> (5_36) 	<br><blue>10(3)</blue>: <m_str>those we had crossed</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>this trip</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>the day</m_str> (12_46) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>the modern world</m_str> (4_16) 	<m_str>the modern world</m_str> (18_9) 	<br><blue>12(4)</blue>: <m_str>we</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>We</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>we</m_str> (12_43) 	<m_str>our</m_str> (13_18) 	<br><blue>13(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Bedouin Arabs</m_str> (8_9) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>his life</m_str> (19_8) 	<m_str>his long life</m_str> (3_8) 	<br><blue>15(2)</blue>: <m_str>that vast desert</m_str> (5_25) 	<m_str>the desert</m_str> (9_3) 	<br><blue>16(1)</blue>: <m_str>Danakil</m_str> (17_14) 	<br><blue>17(4)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (9_10) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (9_5) 	<br><blue>18(4)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (20_18) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (20_5) 	<m_str>this</m_str> (20_23) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (20_25) 	<br><blue>19(1)</blue>: <m_str>the Iraqi marshes</m_str> (18_47) 	<br><blue>20(2)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (10_18) 	<m_str>Sir Wilfred 's books , often illustrated with his own photographs</m_str> (10_1) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
