<blue>1</blue>Maurice Schumann , a French aide to General de Gaulle in London during World War II who made moving broadcasts to Nazi-dominated France and later became a Foreign Minister , died yesterday at the Invalides military hospital in Paris . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 86 . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Schumann was also leader of a political party , a Senator , an author and a member of the French Academy , whose two-score members are known as the Immortals . <br><blue>4</blue>But he was best known among his grateful compatriots for his wartime broadcasting . <br><blue>5</blue>As the Paris newspaper Le Monde put it : '' Beginning in the autumn of 1940 , the voice of the official spokesman of the General suddenly became celebrated . <br><blue>6</blue>This man was at first a voice , ' the voice of France , ' which , during four years of war , maintained the courage and nourished the hope '' of the French populace , which was either directly under German occupation or ruled by the Vichy Government , a tool of the Germans . <br><blue>7</blue>Before there was the '' voice of France , '' there was the jeweler 's son Maurice Schumann , who was born in Paris . <br><blue>8</blue>The journal Current Biography has reported that Maurice 's father was Jewish and from Alsace , and his mother came from a Belgian Roman Catholic family . <br><blue>9</blue>A brilliant student , Maurice Schumann received a degree in literature from the University of Paris and became a Roman Catholic and an ardent anti-Fascist . <br><blue>10</blue>In the 1930 's he worked for the Havas news agency , and he was introduced to de Gaulle before the general became an internationally known figure . <br><blue>11</blue>In 1939 , the year World War II began , Mr. Schumann volunteered for the French Army , became an officer and was taken prisoner by the German invaders . <br><blue>12</blue>But he escaped and joined de Gaulle 's Free French headquarters in London . <br><blue>13</blue>Before long he began making daily broadcasts in French for the BBC . <br><blue>14</blue>As the French journalist Jean Lacouture has written , the broadcasts were at first only five minutes a day , and the precious air time , '' at the General 's personal request , was given to a spokesman in the person of Maurice Schumann , '' whose '' eloquence soon became famous . '' <br><blue>15</blue>An elegant four-story house in London became , for a time , the headquarters for all the Free French civilian and military organizations . <br><blue>16</blue>De Gaulle had a corner office , and on the floor below were the rooms used by Mr. Schumann and other members of the Free French information services . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Schumann became the principal speaker on an evening program , '' The French Speak to the French . '' <br><blue>18</blue>His nasal voice became reassuringly familiar in France , and he became known as '' the spokesman of Fighting France '' who spoke of '' honneur et patrie . '' <br><blue>19</blue>On the program , he denounced French citizens who collaborated with the occupying Germans , and more than once his denunciations were followed by French Resistance fighers ' putting collaborators to death after receiving commands in code like '' the carrots are cooked '' that were broadcast on '' The French Speak to the French . '' <br><blue>20</blue>Paul Reynaud , who was Prime Minister of France early in World War II and later was interned , wrote afterward : '' I had in my luggage a small wireless . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the voice of the official spokesman of the General</m_str> (5_18) 	<m_str>His nasal voice</m_str> (18_1) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the General</m_str> (5_25) 	<m_str>the General 's</m_str> (14_29) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Le Monde</m_str> (5_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (5_8) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>an evening program</m_str> (17_8) 	<m_str>the program</m_str> (19_2) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Germans</m_str> (6_54) 	<m_str>the occupying Germans</m_str> (19_12) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>World War II</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>the year World War II</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>World War II</m_str> (20_12) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Free French</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>Free French</m_str> (16_25) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (20_24) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (20_27) 	<br><blue>9(4)</blue>: <m_str>France</m_str> (6_13) 	<m_str>France</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>France</m_str> (18_8) 	<m_str>France</m_str> (20_9) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>Gaulle before the general</m_str> (10_19) 	<m_str>De Gaulle</m_str> (16_1) 	<br><blue>11(3)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (1_12) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (12_13) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (15_6) 	<br><blue>12(3)</blue>: <m_str>Paris</m_str> (1_39) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (5_3) 	<m_str>Paris</m_str> (7_24) 	<br><blue>13(25)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Schumann</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_11) 	<m_str>the official spokesman of the General</m_str> (5_21) 	<m_str>This man</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>the jeweler 's son Maurice Schumann , who was born in Paris</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>Maurice 's</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>Maurice 's father</m_str> (8_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>Maurice Schumann</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Schumann</m_str> (11_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>Maurice Schumann , '' whose '' eloquence soon became famous</m_str> (14_44) 	<m_str>Jean Lacouture</m_str> (14_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Schumann</m_str> (16_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Schumann</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_20) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>daily broadcasts</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>the broadcasts</m_str> (14_10) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
