<blue>1</blue>Anna Balakian , former chairman of the department of comparative literature at New York University and an internationally recognized scholar in the fields of Symbolism and Surrealism , died on Tuesday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 82 and lived in Old Westbury , N.Y . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was congestive heart failure , said her daughter , Suzanne Nalbantian Reynolds . <br><blue>4</blue>A dynamic woman who said she had '' never been able to draw a line between work and pleasure , '' Dr. Balakian was an early developer of the discipline of comparative literature . <br><blue>5</blue>Proficient in French , German , Spanish and Armenian , she was a prolific author of scholarly essays and wrote several books in her field , among them '' The Literary Origins of Surrealism '' ( 1947 ) , a study of the founders of modern French poetry , and '' Surrealism : The Road to the Absolute '' ( 1959 ) , an exposition of Surrealist literature and art . <br><blue>6</blue>With her sister , Nona Balakian , a literary critic and an editor at The New York Times Book Review , she was part of a literary circle that included the playwright William Saroyan and the diarist Anais Nin . <br><blue>7</blue>Nona Balakian died in 1991 . <br><blue>8</blue>Anna Balakian was also interested in the problems of education , and at her death had completed a wide-ranging critique -- still in manuscript -- of its status in the United States . <br><blue>9</blue>In 1994 she published '' The Snowflake on the Belfry : Dogma and Disquietude in the Critical Arena , '' a consideration of contemporary literary criticism and its warring factions . <br><blue>10</blue>She was born in Constantinople , now Istanbul , in 1915 to Armenian parents , moved with her family to Germany as a child and later lived on the Swiss-French border before coming to the United States at the age of 11 . <br><blue>11</blue>She spoke and wrote in recent years against what she saw as tendencies toward separatism and divisiveness in a multicultural America . <br><blue>12</blue>A prominent theme in these articles was '' the vast international connections and kinships '' that she viewed as binding together people of different nationalities . <br><blue>13</blue>Dr. Balakian earned a bachelor 's degree at Hunter College in 1936 and master 's and Ph.D. degrees at Columbia University in 1938 and 1943 . <br><blue>14</blue>While in graduate school , she taught French literature and language full time at Hunter College High School . <br><blue>15</blue>Toward the end of

Orchestra . <br><blue>17</blue>She was married in 1945 to Stepan Nalbantian , a fellow violinist and an electrical engineer , who died in 1984 . <br><blue>18</blue>Throughout her life , she retained her maiden name . <br><blue>19</blue>In 1953 , Dr. Balakian began her career at New York University as an instructor in French , eventually moving into the field of comparative literature .
