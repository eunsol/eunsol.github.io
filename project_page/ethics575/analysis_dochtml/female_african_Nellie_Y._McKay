<blue>1</blue>Nellie Y. McKay , a distinguished scholar and critic who helped secure a place for African-American women in the modern literary canon , died last Sunday at a hospice in Fitchburg , Wis . <br><blue>2</blue>She was a resident of Madison , Wis. , and was believed to have been in her mid-70 's . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , said Craig Werner , chairman of the Afro-American studies department at the University of Wisconsin , where Ms. McKay was Evjue professor of American and African-American literature . <br><blue>4</blue>An authority on black American literature of the 19th and 20th centuries , Professor McKay specialized in the study of fiction , autobiography and , especially , women 's writing . <br><blue>5</blue>She was known in particular for the Norton Anthology of African American Literature , of which she was a general editor with Henry Louis Gates Jr. '' She was the central figure in the establishing of black women 's studies as a presence in academic and intellectual life , '' Professor Werner said in a telephone interview yesterday . <br><blue>6</blue>The anthology , published in 1997 , was widely credited with codifying the black American literary canon for the first time . <br><blue>7</blue>The book , which generated considerable attention in the news media , was assigned in college courses worldwide and also proved popular with a general readership . <br><blue>8</blue>Nearly 200,000 copies are currently in print , the publisher said yesterday . <br><blue>9</blue>At more than 2,600 pages , the anthology spans black literature from the earliest Negro spirituals to late-20th-century writers like Gloria Naylor , Terry McMillan and Walter Mosley . <br><blue>10</blue>It was published in a second edition in 2004 , adding the work of younger writers like Edwidge Danticat and Colson Whitehead . '' <br><blue>11</blue>It 's very necessary that we do this to establish the centrality of the African-American experience , '' Professor McKay told The New York Times in 1996 . '' <br><blue>12</blue>There needed to be a book that gave a coherent text of African-American literature . '' <br><blue>13</blue>Nellie Yvonne Reynolds was born in Queens to parents who had come from Jamaica in the West Indies . <br><blue>14</blue>She earned a bachelor 's degree in English from Queens College in 1969 , a master 's in English and American literature from Harvard in 1971 and a Ph.D. in the same field from Harvard in 1977 . <br><blue>15</blue>She joined the Wisconsin faculty the next year ; at her death , she held a joint appointment in the English and Afro-American studies departments , and also taught in the women 's studies department . <br><blue>16</blue>As she and her contemporaries discovered during their student years , it was nearly impossible to study literature by black writers , male or female , in a university classroom in the late 1960 's . <br><blue>17</blue>Students interested in the subject , as she often said afterward , had to learn from one another . '' <br><blue>18</blue>Today , no self-respecting English department would dare not teach African-American literature , '' Mr. Gates , the W. E. B. Du Bois professor of the humanities at Harvard , said in an interview . '' <br><blue>19</blue>But when Nellie was a student , that was n't the case . <br><blue>20</blue>Black literature courses were few and far between .
