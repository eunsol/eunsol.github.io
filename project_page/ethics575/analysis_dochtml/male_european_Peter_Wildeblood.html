<blue>1</blue>Peter Wildeblood , a former journalist and television producer whose personal war against British law helped lead to the decriminalization of homosexuality in 1967 , died on Nov. 13 in Vancouver , British Columbia . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 76 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause of death was complications resulting from a paralyzing stroke , said Lord Montagu of Beaulieu , a longtime friend . <br><blue>4</blue>On March 24 , 1954 , Mr. Wildeblood , having freely said in court that he was a homosexual , was found guilty of conspiring to incite a young man to commit what were then described in law as indecent acts . <br><blue>5</blue>He and a co-defendant , Michael Pitt-Rivers , were sentenced to 18 months in prison . <br><blue>6</blue>Lord Montagu , another defendant , was given a one-year sentence . <br><blue>7</blue>After his conviction , Mr. Wilde blood was dismissed from his job as diplomatic correspondent for The London Daily Mail . <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Wildeblood 's account of his experiences in the courts and in prison in a book called '' Against the Law '' ( Weidenfeld and Nicholson , 1955 and 1999 ) prompted debates in both houses of Parliament and led to the establishment of a government panel called the Wolfenden Committee to review the law dealing with male homosexual practices and female prostitution ; lesbianism had never been illegal in Britain . <br><blue>9</blue>In 1957 , the committee recommended the decriminalization of private homosexual acts between consenting adults over age 21 , and suggested that prostitution , which was not illegal , be allowed to continue . <br><blue>10</blue>But it was not until 10 years later that the recommendations were made into law . '' <br><blue>11</blue>The right which I claim for myself , and for all those like me , is the right to choose the person whom I love , '' Mr. Wildeblood once said . <br><blue>12</blue>Peter Wildeblood was born in Alassio on the Italian Riviera in 1923 , the son of a retired engineer . <br><blue>13</blue>He went to Oxford on a scholarship , but became ill and dropped out after 10 days . <br><blue>14</blue>He was accepted as a pilot by the Royal Air Force and sent to what was then Southern Rhodesia for training . <br><blue>15</blue>After several crashes , he was grounded , and served during World War II in the Meteorological Branch . <br><blue>16</blue>He returned to Oxford and graduated two years after the war , then worked for a series of newspapers in the north of England and sold freelance articles to Punch and Vogue . <br><blue>17</blue>He joined The Daily Mail in 1950 and was soon named diplomatic correspondent . <br><blue>18</blue>After his release from prison , he operated a popular bar in the Soho district of London and published a fictionalized biography , '' A Way of Life '' ( 1956 ) , followed by two novels , a play and several musicals for which he wrote the book and lyrics . <br><blue>19</blue>Gradually , Mr. Wildeblood shifted his attention to television production and was so successful that in the early 1970 's he accepted a lucrative offer from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and moved to Vancouver . <br><blue>20</blue>In 1994 , a stroke left him almost completely paralyzed and speechless but mentally alert . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Lord Montagu of Beaulieu , a longtime friend</m_str> (3_14) 	<m_str>Lord Montagu , another defendant</m_str> (6_1) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>whose personal war against British law</m_str> (1_10) 	<m_str>the war</m_str> (16_10) 	<br><blue>3(4)</blue>: <m_str>myself</m_str> (11_7) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>me</m_str> (11_14) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (11_4) 	<br><blue>4(22)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Wildeblood</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Wildeblood 's</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (8_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Wildeblood</m_str> (11_28) 	<m_str>Peter Wildeblood</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_46) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (18_7) 	<m_str>Mr. Wildeblood</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_21) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (20_7) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Wolfenden Committee</m_str> (8_49) 	<m_str>the committee</m_str> (9_4) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (10_2) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>British law</m_str> (1_14) 	<m_str>the Law</m_str> (8_20) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
