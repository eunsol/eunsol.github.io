         <h1>Douglas Corrigan, 88, Dies; Wrong-Way Trip Was the Right Way toCelebrity as an Aviator </h1>

 					<p class="text-left">
<blue>1</blue>Douglas Corrigan , a brash , errant aviator who captured the imagination of a Depression-weary public in 1938 when he took off from Brooklyn on a nonstop solo flight to Los Angeles and landed his improbable airplane in Dublin a day later , died on Saturday at a hospital in Orange , Calif . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 88 and had been lionized for more than half a century as Wrong Way Corrigan . <br><blue>3</blue>The few people who were at Floyd Bennett Field when Mr. Corrigan took off at 5:15 on the morning of July 17 , 1938 , were baffled when the 31-year-old aviator turned into a cloud bank and disappeared to the east . <br><blue>4</blue>According to his flight plan , he should have been heading west . <br><blue>5</blue>As they and the world learned when his jerry-built , overloaded secondhand airplane touched down at Dublin 's Baldonnel Airport 28 hours and 13 minutes later , Mr. Corrigan had not only known what he was doing , he had also flown straight into the hearts of the American people . <br><blue>6</blue>" I 'm Douglas Corrigan , " he told a group of startled Irish airport workers who gathered around him when he landed . <br><blue>7</blue>" Just got in from New York . <br><blue>8</blue>Where am I ? <br><blue>9</blue>I intended to fly to California . " <br><blue>10</blue>Although he continued to claim with a more or less straight face that he had simply made a wrong turn and been led astray by a faulty compass , the story was far from convincing , especially to the American aviation authorities who had rejected his repeated requests to make just such a flight because his modified 1929 Curtiss-Robin monoplane was judged unworthy of more than an experimental aircraft certification . <br><blue>11</blue>Unmoved by evidence that he had not checked weather reports for the North Atlantic before his flight and had carried charts showing only his supposedly planned route to California , the authorities deemed his plane so unsafe and his flight so illegal that it took a 600-word official telegram to detail all the regulations he had violated . <br><blue>12</blue>But if Mr. Corrigan had such a twinkle in his eye when he told his story that he appeared to be trying to suppress a wink , the authorities had trouble stifling a wink of their own . <br><blue>13</blue>Although his pilot 's license was instantly suspended , Mr. Corrigan , who returned to the United States by ship , did not miss a minute of flying time . <br><blue>14</blue>He served the entire suspension at sea . <br><blue>15</blue>The license was reinstated as soon as he and his crated-up plane sailed into New York Harbor aboard the liner Manhattan on Aug. 4 , and received a tumultuous greeting . <br><blue>16</blue>There was an even larger welcome the next day when an estimated one million New Yorkers lined lower Broadway for a ticker-tape parade that eclipsed the one given for Charles A. Lindbergh after his solo flight to Paris in 1927 . <br><blue>17</blue>Mr. Corrigan 's 3,150-mile flight was an immediate sensation , pushing depressing economic news and grim international reports aside on the front pages of American newspapers and dominating radio broadcasts across the country . <br><blue>18</blue>Although half a dozen well-known pilots , among them Amelia Earhart and Wylie Post , had made solo flights across the Atlantic since Lindbergh had blazed the trail in the Spirit of St. Louis in 1927 , none struck such a chord with the American people as Mr. Corrigan did . <br><blue>19</blue>That was partly because he was seen as an engaging and impish young pilot who had boldly thumbed his nose at authority , then baldly denied it , and partly because he had made the flight not in a state of the art aircraft with cutting edge instruments , but in a rickety plane so precariously patched together that it was variously dubbed an airborne crate and a flying jalopy . <br><blue>20</blue>Among other things , Mr. Corrigan , who had bought the plane in New York as a wreck for $ 310 in 1935 and nursed it cow pasture by cow pasture back to California , had ripped out the original 90-horsepower engine and replaced it with a 165-horsepower model cobbled together from two old Wright engines . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>Dublin</m_str> (1_39) 	<m_str>Dublin 's</m_str> (5_17) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>million New Yorkers</m_str> (16_14) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (18_9) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the story</m_str> (10_30) 	<m_str>his story</m_str> (12_15) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>his nose</m_str> (19_19) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (19_27) 	<br><blue>5(3)</blue>: <m_str>the authorities</m_str> (11_31) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (12_36) 	<m_str>the authorities</m_str> (12_28) 	<br><blue>6(44)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (1_20) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_35) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Corrigan</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>the 31-year-old aviator</m_str> (3_29) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_3) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Corrigan</m_str> (5_28) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_35) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_39) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>Douglas Corrigan</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_8) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (6_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_22) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (8_3) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_46) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_56) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_16) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_34) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_39) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_55) 	<m_str>Mr. Corrigan</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_13) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_18) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>his pilot 's</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Corrigan , who returned to the United States by ship</m_str> (13_10) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_10) 	<m_str>Mr. Corrigan 's</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Corrigan</m_str> (18_48) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_32) 	<br><blue>7(4)</blue>: <m_str>his solo flight</m_str> (16_34) 	<m_str>Mr. Corrigan 's 3,150-mile flight</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>the flight</m_str> (19_35) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (19_60) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>the North Atlantic</m_str> (11_12) 	<m_str>the Atlantic</m_str> (18_21) 	<br><blue>9(3)</blue>: <m_str>Charles A.
