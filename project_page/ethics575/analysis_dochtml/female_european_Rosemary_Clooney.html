<blue>1</blue>Rosemary Clooney , whose warm , radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century , died Saturday night at her home in Beverly Hills . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 74 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was complications from lung cancer , according to her spokeswoman , Linda Dozoretz . <br><blue>4</blue>Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did ; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Torm√© seemed to do so easily ; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald . <br><blue>5</blue>But she sang with so much assuredness , simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike . <br><blue>6</blue>In the words of the director Mike Nichols , '' She sings like Spencer Tracy acts . '' <br><blue>7</blue>In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and on concert stages , largely with small groups , singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect . <br><blue>8</blue>Reviewing a performance at Michael 's Pub in Manhattan , Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her : '' Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth , intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity . <br><blue>9</blue>Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive . <br><blue>10</blue>Rather than acting out the romantic dramas of well-known song lyrics , she projects an understanding that is almost maternal in its blend of wisdom and empathy . '' <br><blue>11</blue>Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers , Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen , Cole Porter , Duke Ellington , George and Ira Gershwin , Johnny Burke , Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart , her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished . <br><blue>12</blue>She became one of America 's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called '' Come-on-a-My House , '' which became a huge hit record , and followed that with other novelties like '' Botcha-Me , '' '' Mambo Italiano '' and '' This Old House , '' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear long after she was pursuing a less-flamboyant repertory . <br><blue>13</blue>Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing '' How Much Is That Doggie in the Window ? '' <br><blue>14</blue>a novelty that belonged to Patti Page , never to Rosemary Clooney . '' <br><blue>15</blue>They probably figure if it 's a bad song I must have done it , '' she once said about her earlier recording career . <br><blue>16</blue>But even then Ms. Clooney recorded pensive ballads like '' Tenderly '' and '' Hey There '' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her . <br><blue>17</blue>Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate . <br><blue>18</blue>Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical '' White Christmas . '' <br><blue>19</blue>But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain . <br><blue>20</blue>She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer ; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy , which she witnessed first hand ; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her ; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family . <br><hr><br><blue>1(43)</blue>: <m_str>Rosemary Clooney , whose warm , radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_10) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_30) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_11) 	<m_str>Ms. Clooney</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_20) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_41) 	<m_str>Ella Fitzgerald</m_str> (4_51) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_16) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (5_20) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (6_11) 	<m_str>Ms. Clooney</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_28) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_20) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (8_23) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (8_32) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_45) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (10_13) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_4) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (11_46) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (12_52) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_60) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_6) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (15_17) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (15_21) 	<m_str>then Ms. Clooney</m_str> (16_3) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (16_31) 	<m_str>Ms. Clooney with a good ballad</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Her</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (18_10) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (19_2) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_12) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_19) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_25) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_30) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (20_40) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (20_42) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>a novelty that belonged to Patti Page , never to Rosemary Clooney</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (15_14) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>They</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (16_24) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>her earlier recording career</m_str> (15_21) 	<m_str>Her early career</m_str> (18_1) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Rosemary Clooney</m_str> (14_11) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>a life</m_str> (19_9) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
