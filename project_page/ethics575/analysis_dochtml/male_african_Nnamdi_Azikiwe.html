<blue>1</blue>Nnamdi Azikiwe , Nigeria 's first President and a vigorous champion of African independence from European colonial rule , died Saturday in a hospital in his native eastern Nigeria after a long illness . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 91 . <br><blue>3</blue>Dr. Azikiwe , an Ibo from southeast Nigeria , presided over a democratic Government that was in power for a mere three years before the regional tensions that have marked the country 's politics ever since led to the first of many military coups . <br><blue>4</blue>But as a lawyer , political scientist , journalist , political activist , President and for many years Nigeria 's elder statesman , Dr. Azikiwe towered over the affairs of Africa 's most populous nation , attaining the rare status of a truly national hero who came to be admired across the regional and ethnic lines dividing his country . <br><blue>5</blue>After years of agitation for nationhood , Dr. Azikiwe became Governor General of the Nigerian Federation at independence from Britain in 1960 , and President in 1963 , when the country was declared a republic . <br><blue>6</blue>While in office , he introduced universal adult suffrage and moved to extend schooling throughout the country . <br><blue>7</blue>When Nigeria 's civil war erupted in 1967 , after a disastrous attempt at secession led by the Ibo general Chukwuemeka Ojukwu , Dr. Azikiwe broke ranks with leaders from his own ethnic group who supported the bid to form an independent nation called Biafra . <br><blue>8</blue>For a time , his support of a united Nigeria earned him the scorn of many in his native southeast . <br><blue>9</blue>But with his customary political aplomb , Dr. Azikiwe soon emerged from the ashes of a defeated Biafra to figure prominently in the country 's triangular ethnic coalition politics . <br><blue>10</blue>He ran again for the presidency twice , in 1979 and 1983 , during a brief interlude of democracy between military governments . <br><blue>11</blue>But although he ran strongly in his native region each time , he ended up throwing his support to rivals from the north . <br><blue>12</blue>Early in his career , Dr. Azikiwe seemed to realize that his Ibo group , the smallest of Nigeria 's three major ethnic sub-divisions , could never rule the country outright . <br><blue>13</blue>This insight led him to form alliances with northern politicians from the Muslim Hausa-Fulani ethnic constellation that would give him a far greater say in the country 's affairs than he could have hoped for alone . <br><blue>14</blue>Throughout his life , Dr. Azikiwe 's alliance with northerners put him at odds with Obafemi Awolowo , a socialist-inclined leader of the Yoruba , the country 's other important southern group . <br><blue>15</blue>In the view of Mr. Awolowo 's supporters and many other Nigerians , Dr. Azikiwe 's compact with the north opened the country to domination by the north and by the military , whose senior officer corps is dominated by people of Hausa and Fulani background . <br><blue>16</blue>Born Nov. 16 , 1904 , in Zungeru in northern Nigeria , where his father was stationed as a colonial civil servant , Nnamdi Azikiwe attended English-run missionary schools . <br><blue>17</blue>He then went to the United States , where he studied at Storer College in West Virginia , Howard University in Washington , D.C. , Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and Columbia University in New York City . <br><blue>18</blue>Dr. Azikiwe taught political science at Lincoln University for three years in the early 1930 's before returning to Africa , where he founded the first of five newspapers he would create , The African Morning Post , in Accra , Ghana , in 1934 . <br><blue>19</blue>In Ghana , Dr. Azikiwe became a mentor to Kwame Nkrumah , the Premier of that British colony who would go on to become the President of the first African country to free itself from European rule , in 1957 . <br><blue>20</blue>Dr. Azikiwe returned to Nigeria in 1937 and worked as an editor and essayist before throwing himself into the limited local politics under colonial rule , becoming a member of the Legislative Council in 1948 . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the north</m_str> (11_22) 	<m_str>the north</m_str> (15_19) 	<br><blue>2(15)</blue>: <m_str>Nigeria
