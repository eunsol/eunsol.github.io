<blue>1</blue>Jessica Tandy , who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have , died yesterday at her home in Easton , Conn . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 85 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was ovarian cancer , said her husband , the actor Hume Cronyn . <br><blue>4</blue>Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams 's " Streetcar Named Desire , " and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film " Driving Miss Daisy . " <br><blue>5</blue>In the years between , she and Mr. Cronyn , played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day . <br><blue>6</blue>With the role of Blanche Dubois , Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood 's leading ladies , to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage . <br><blue>7</blue>The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance , which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called " incredibly true . " <br><blue>8</blue>Almost four decades later , another New York Times drama critic , Frank Rich , wrote of her , " Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets , not theater critics , should be allowed to write about her . " <br><blue>9</blue>When she was 80 years old , she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in " Driving Miss Daisy . " <br><blue>10</blue>It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and , at last , an Academy Award . <br><blue>11</blue>When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one . <br><blue>12</blue>She vowed to go on working , although she said she hoped she would know when to stop , " before they have to get the hook . " <br><blue>13</blue>The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of " Foxfire , " of which her husband was was a co-writer . <br><blue>14</blue>Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work , completing three films and two television dramas . <br><blue>15</blue>A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together , in " The Fourposter " in 1951 , audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater . <br><blue>16</blue>One triumph followed another , culminating in " The Gin Game " in 1977 and " Foxfire " in 1982 . <br><blue>17</blue>By 1986 , when they appeared in " The Petition , " Mr. Rich was writing of " their legendary theatrical relationship " and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as " an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again . " <br><blue>18</blue>Mel Gussow , another drama critic for The Times , called them " two actors at their summit . " <br><blue>19</blue>He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together , it was " a matter of hearts , minds and bodies in creative harmony . " <br><blue>20</blue>One of their last projects together was " To Dance With the White Dog , " a television movie that had its premiere last year . <br><hr><br><blue>1(4)</blue>: <m_str>the American theater</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>the American theater</m_str> (15_45) 	<m_str>the Broadway theater</m_str> (17_37) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (17_45) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (17_19) 	<m_str>they</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (18_17) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (18_12) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Cronyns</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (19_10) 	<br><blue>4(28)</blue>: <m_str>Jessica Tandy , who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (1_22) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (3_8) 	<m_str>Blanche Dubois</m_str> (4_9) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (4_33) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (5_6) 	<m_str>herself</m_str> (6_31) 	<m_str>Blanche Dubois</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (7_11) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_18) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (8_44) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_2) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (9_15) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (10_7) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>She</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (12_13) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>her</m_str> (13_26) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_3) 	<m_str>she</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>Lynn Fontanne</m_str> (15_38) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Hollywood 's leading ladies</m_str> (6_24) 	<m_str>the leading ladies of the stage</m_str> (6_35) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Broadway</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>Broadway</m_str> (17_38) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Cronyn</m_str> (5_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Cronyn</m_str> (15_11) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>New York Times</m_str> (7_16) 	<m_str>New York Times</m_str> (8_7) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Miss Tandy</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>Miss Tandy</m_str> (6_8) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>a television movie that had its premiere last year</m_str> (20_17) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>an aging</m_str> (9_18) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (10_1) 	<br><blue>12(1)</blue>: <m_str>the role of Blanche Dubois</m_str> (6_2) 	<br><blue>13(2)</blue>: <m_str>an Academy Award</m_str> (10_20) 	<m_str>The Academy Award</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>14(2)</blue>: <m_str>her husband , the actor Hume Cronyn</m_str> (3_8) 	<m_str>her husband</m_str> (13_26) 	<hr><br> gender:female	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
