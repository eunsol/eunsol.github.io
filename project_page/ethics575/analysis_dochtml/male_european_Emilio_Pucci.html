<blue>1</blue>Emilio Pucci , the Italian fashion designer whose brilliantly colored prints were an icon of the 1960 's , died Sunday morning in a nursing home in Florence . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 78 years old . <br><blue>3</blue>He died of a heart attack , said Pier Gabriele Bulli , director of the home . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Pucci , who was the Marchese di Barsento , was born in Naples , into an aristocratic Italian family . <br><blue>5</blue>He lived and worked in the Pucci Palace in Florence . <br><blue>6</blue>An enthusiastic sportsman who was on the Italian Olympic ski team in 1932 , he also raced cars and excelled in swimming , tennis and fencing . <br><blue>7</blue>His emergence as a fashion designer happened somewhat accidentally . <br><blue>8</blue>He was an Italian bomber pilot in World War II and he continued in the air force after the war , holding the rank of captain . <br><blue>9</blue>On leave in Switzerland in 1947 , he was spotted on the ski slopes by Toni Frissel , a photographer , who was impressed by the snugness of his ski garb , which was custom made of stretch fabrics . <br><blue>10</blue>Forefront of Italian Fashion When photographs of Mr. Pucci in his skisuit appeared in Harper 's Bazaar , he was besieged by American manufacturers who wanted to produce it . <br><blue>11</blue>He decided instead to market the ski clothes himself . <br><blue>12</blue>They were among the first styles made of stretch fabrics , and Lord &amp; Taylor was among the first to promote them . <br><blue>13</blue>By 1950 , Mr. Pucci was at the forefront of the fledgling Italian fashion industry . <br><blue>14</blue>His forte in the beginning was sports clothes , but he soon moved into other fashions , including brilliantly patterned silk scarves . <br><blue>15</blue>Encouraged by Stanley Marcus , one of the owners of Neiman-Marcus , he began making blouses and then dresses of the patterned material . <br><blue>16</blue>By the 1960 's , a dress in the distinctively patterned Pucci print , which used as many as 16 colors in a single design , was the uniform of fashionable women everywhere in the world . <br><blue>17</blue>Elizabeth Taylor , Lauren Bacall , Gina Lollobrigida and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis were some of the women photographed in Pucci designs . <br><blue>18</blue>An Interest in Politics Two years ago there was a worldwide revival of the Pucci fashion . <br><blue>19</blue>Madonna , Monica Seles and Christie Brinkley are some of the women who have recently stopped into the Pucci boutique at 24 East 64th Steet in Manhattan , said Elizabeth Penberthy , the manager . <br><blue>20</blue>" Few designers peak twice in fashion , " Ms. Penberthy said . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (10_29) 	<m_str>Harper 's Bazaar</m_str> (10_15) 	<br><blue>2(6)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Pucci in his skisuit</m_str> (10_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Pucci</m_str> (13_4) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_13) 	<m_str>the distinctively patterned Pucci</m_str> (16_9) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Florence</m_str> (1_28) 	<m_str>Florence</m_str> (5_10) 	<br><blue>4(13)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_12) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_29) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_19) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>Elizabeth Penberthy , the manager</m_str> (19_30) 	<m_str>Ms. Penberthy</m_str> (20_10) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>Pucci</m_str> (17_20) 	<m_str>Pucci</m_str> (19_19) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>them</m_str> (12_22) 	<m_str>They</m_str> (12_1) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>a fashion designer</m_str> (7_4) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>a nursing home in Florence</m_str> (1_24) 	<m_str>the home</m_str> (3_15) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
