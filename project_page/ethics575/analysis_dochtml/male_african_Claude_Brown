<blue>1</blue>Claude Brown , whose 1965 book , '' Manchild in the Promised Land , '' chronicled his ascent from a harrowing childhood of violent crime and poverty in Harlem and became a classic of American literature , died on Feb. 2 in Manhattan . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 64 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was a lung condition , said Laura Higgins , his companion . '' <br><blue>4</blue>Manchild in the Promised Land '' quickly became a best seller , opening up a new world to mainstream audiences with its raw narrative of a boyhood spent among killers , drug addicts and prostitutes . <br><blue>5</blue>Though not published as a memoir , it closely paralleled Mr. Brown 's life in virtually every detail . '' <br><blue>6</blue>What many of us talk about in abstractions , '' wrote the critic Irving Howe , '' is here given the quivery reality of a boy 's life , his struggle , his efforts at understanding . <br><blue>7</blue>This book contributes to our sense of what America is today . '' <br><blue>8</blue>Published at the height of the civil rights movement , the book reached far beyond the traditional literary world , drawing new attention to the lives of urban blacks . <br><blue>9</blue>It has sold more than 4 million copies and has been translated into 14 languages . <br><blue>10</blue>Today , it sells more than 30,000 copies a year and is required reading in many high schools and colleges . <br><blue>11</blue>Many saw the book 's direct , profanity-laced style as a challenge to the reigning generation of African-American writers . '' <br><blue>12</blue>Claude Brown makes James Baldwin and all that old Rock of Ages rhetoric sound like some kind of Moral Rearmament tourist from Toronto come to visit the poor , '' Tom Wolfe wrote in The New York Herald Tribune when the book came out . <br><blue>13</blue>Claude Brown was born in 1937 in Harlem and grew up in a tenement on 146th Street and Eighth Avenue with his younger brother and two sisters . <br><blue>14</blue>His parents , a railroad worker and a domestic worker , had moved up from South Carolina two years before , like thousands of other Southern blacks seeking opportunities in Northern cities at midcentury . <br><blue>15</blue>As he wrote in the book : '' Going to New York was goodbye to the cotton fields , goodbye to ' Massa Charlie , ' goodbye to the chain gang , and , most of all , goodbye to those sunup-to-sundown working hours . <br><blue>16</blue>One no longer had to wait to get to heaven to lay his burden down ; burdens could be laid down in New York . '' <br><blue>17</blue>Yet life in the promised land of New York turned out to be much harder than the migrants had imagined . <br><blue>18</blue>Claude -- known as Sonny to his friends and in the book -- was expelled from school at 8 , admitted to a street gang at 9 , shot in the leg during a burglary at 13 and confined to a reform school at 14 . <br><blue>19</blue>But by that time he had made the acquaintance of Dr. Ernest Papanek , a psychologist and the director of the Wiltwyck School for deprived and emotionally disturbed boys , which was in Ulster County , N.Y. Dr. Papanek , whom Mr. Brown described in his book as '' probably the smartest and the deepest cat I had ever met , '' encouraged him to seek an education . <br><blue>20</blue>Eventually , he began attending night classes at a high school downtown , supporting himself by working as a busboy , deliveryman and other jobs . <br><hr><br><blue>1(10)</blue>: <m_str>the book</m_str> (15_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>his book</m_str> (19_46) 	<m_str>the book</m_str> (8_11) 	<m_str>the book</m_str> (12_41) 	<m_str>1965 book</m_str> (1_5) 	<m_str>This book</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>the book</m_str> (18_11) 	<m_str>the book 's</m_str> (11_3) 	<br><blue>2(12)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (20_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_5) 	<m_str>Claude Brown</m_str> (12_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Claude Brown</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_22) 	<m_str>Claude</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (18_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (16_13) 	<m_str>Claude Brown</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>its</m_str> (4_22) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (5_8) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (16_23) 	<m_str>New York</m_str> (17_8) 	<br><blue>5(4)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_17) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>the critic</m_str> (6_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_12) 	<br><blue>6(5)</blue>: <m_str>him</m_str> (19_64) 	<m_str>Mr. Brown 's</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>Mr. Brown</m_str> (19_42) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_46) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (19_57) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>Harlem</m_str> (13_8) 	<m_str>Harlem</m_str> (1_29) 	<br><blue>8(3)</blue>: <m_str>a boy 's</m_str> (6_25) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_30) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_33) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>us</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>our</m_str> (7_5) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>America</m_str> (7_9) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:african<br>         </p>
