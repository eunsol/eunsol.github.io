<blue>1</blue>Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel , who was shot dead yesterday at age 73 , was a soldier turned statesman who led his country into uncharted territory to make peace with the Palestinians and put an end to the wars , bloodshed and terrorism that had plagued his country since its founding . <br><blue>2</blue>It was General Rabin , the Commander in Chief of Israel 's armed forces in 1967 , who had led the lightning strike that captured broad swaths of Arab territories . <br><blue>3</blue>Twenty-six years later , on Sept. 13 , 1993 , it was Prime Minister Rabin who reluctantly extended his hand to Yasir Arafat , leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization , to put a symbolic seal of approval on an accord that would lead to the return of much of that territory and to Palestinian self-rule on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip . <br><blue>4</blue>In an extraordinary ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House , one that few had ever expected to see , Mr. Rabin came face-to-face with Mr. Arafat -- the man who had been reviled for decades by Israelis as the mastermind behind one attack after another on their people , the man with whom the following year he and his Foreign Minister , Shimon Peres , would share the Nobel Peace Prize . <br><blue>5</blue>" The time for peace has come , " Mr. Rabin declared . <br><blue>6</blue>" We , the soldiers who have returned from battles stained with blood , we who have seen our relatives and friends killed before our eyes , . . . we who have come from a land where parents bury their children , we who have fought against you , the Palestinians -- we say today in a loud and clear voice : Enough of blood and tears . <br><blue>7</blue>Enough . " <br><blue>8</blue>Speaking as much to his own people as to the astonished world that was watching , Mr. Rabin explained in mournful tones how painful and how necessary it was for Israel to take this step . <br><blue>9</blue>" It 's not so easy -- either for myself as a soldier in Israel 's war nor for the people of Israel . . . . <br><blue>10</blue>It is certainly not easy for the families of the victims of the war 's violence , terror , whose pain will never heal , for the many thousands who defended our lives and their own and have even sacrificed their lives for our own . <br><blue>11</blue>For them this ceremony has come too late . " <br><blue>12</blue>But he said Israel was not seeking revenge . <br><blue>13</blue>It was seeking peace . <br><blue>14</blue>The tragedy was that some of Mr. Rabin 's own people were seeking revenge . <br><blue>15</blue>As Mr. Rabin came closer to achieving his goal of peace , a wide schism opened within the Israeli populace . <br><blue>16</blue>Much of the bitterness of those opposed to making peace with Israel 's historic enemies was directed at Mr. Rabin , and he became the soldier who paid the ultimate price to make peace . <br><blue>17</blue>He had been unrelenting in his drive to institutionalize that peace . <br><blue>18</blue>Only a month ago , Mr. Rabin took part in another White House ceremony to mark the beginning of another withdrawal from the West Bank . <br><blue>19</blue>This time the handshakes with Mr. Arafat were less reluctant and the peace process was well established . <br><blue>20</blue>A New Generation Brings a New Vision Mr. Rabin was the only one of Israel 's eight Prime Ministers to have been born in the land of Palestine , a Sabra who had not experienced the long history of attacks on European Jewry and the horror of the Holocaust . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>our</m_str> (10_44) 	<m_str>our</m_str> (10_32) 	<br><blue>2(4)</blue>: <m_str>their</m_str> (10_41) 	<m_str>the many thousands who defended our lives and their own and have even sacrificed their lives for our own</m_str> (10_27) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (10_35) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (11_2) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>an extraordinary ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House , one that few had ever expected to see</m_str> (4_2) 	<m_str>this ceremony</m_str> (11_3) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>his</m_str> (1_49) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_24) 	<br><blue>5(12)</blue>: <m_str>his country</m_str> (1_49) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (1_52) 	<m_str>Israel</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>Israel</m_str> (1_6) 	<m_str>Israel 's</m_str> (16_12) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (13_1) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Israel 's</m_str> (20_15) 	<m_str>Israel 's</m_str> (9_15) 	<m_str>his country</m_str> (1_24) 	<m_str>Israel 's</m_str> (2_11) 	<m_str>Israel</m_str> (9_23) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>that territory</m_str> (3_51) 	<m_str>uncharted territory</m_str> (1_27) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>another on their people , the man with whom the following year he and his Foreign Minister , Shimon Peres , would share the Nobel Peace Prize</m_str> (4_48) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (4_50) 	<br><blue>8(7)</blue>: <m_str>we</m_str> (6_42) 	<m_str>we</m_str> (6_29) 	<m_str>we</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>We</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>our</m_str> (6_19) 	<m_str>we</m_str> (6_52) 	<m_str>our</m_str> (6_25) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>parents</m_str> (6_37) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (6_39) 	<br><blue>10(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Palestinians</m_str> (1_33) 	<m_str>the Palestinians</m_str> (6_49) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Arafat</m_str> (4_28) 	<m_str>Mr. Arafat</m_str> (19_6) 	<br><blue>12(2)</blue>: <m_str>the war 's</m_str> (10_13) 	<m_str>Israel 's war</m_str> (9_15) 	<br><blue>13(15)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Rabin</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (17_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Rabin</m_str> (16_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_6) 	<m_str>Mr. Rabin</m_str> (18_6) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Rabin</m_str> (4_23) 	<m_str>a New Vision Mr. Rabin</m_str> (20_5) 	<m_str>Mr. Rabin</m_str> (5_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (4_60) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_62) 	<m_str>Mr. Rabin</m_str> (8_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Rabin 's</m_str> (14_7) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:asian<br>         </p>
