<blue>1</blue>Robert K. Merton , one of the most influential sociologists of the 20th century , whose coinage of terms like '' self-fulfilling prophecy '' and '' role models '' filtered from his academic pursuits into everyday language , died yesterday . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 92 and lived in Manhattan . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Merton gained his pioneering reputation as a sociologist of science , exploring how scientists behave and what it is that motivates , rewards , and intimidates them . <br><blue>4</blue>By laying out his '' ethos of science '' in 1942 , he replaced the entrenched stereotypical views that had long held scientists to be eccentric geniuses largely unbound by rules or norms . <br><blue>5</blue>It was this body of work that contributed to Mr. Merton 's becoming the first sociologist to win a National Medal of Science in 1994 . <br><blue>6</blue>But his explorations over 70-odd years extended across an extraordinary range of interests that included the workings of the mass media , the anatomy of racism , the social perspectives of '' insiders '' vs. '' outsiders , '' history , literature and etymology . <br><blue>7</blue>Though carried out with the detachment he admired in Emile Durkheim , the French architect of modern sociology , Mr. Merton 's inquiries often bore important consequences in real life as well as in academics . <br><blue>8</blue>His studies on an integrated community helped shape Kenneth Clark 's historic brief in Brown v. Board of Education , the Supreme Court case that led to the desegregation of public schools . <br><blue>9</blue>His adoption of the focused interview to elicit the responses of groups to texts , radio programs and films led to the '' focus groups '' that politicians , their handlers , marketers and hucksters now find indispensable . <br><blue>10</blue>Long after he had helped devise the methodology , Mr. Merton deplored its abuse and misuse but added , '' I wish I 'd get a royalty on it . '' <br><blue>11</blue>He spent much of his professional life at Columbia University , where along with his collaborator of 35 years , Paul F. Lazarsfeld , who died in 1976 , he developed the Bureau of Applied Social Research , where the early focus groups originated . <br><blue>12</blue>The course of his career paralleled the growth and acceptance of sociology as a bona fide academic discipline . <br><blue>13</blue>As late as 1939 there were fewer than a 1,000 sociologists in the United States , but soon after Mr. Merton was elected president of the American Sociological Association in 1957 , the group had 4,500 members . <br><blue>14</blue>Mr. Merton was sometimes called '' Mr. Sociology , '' and Jonathan R. Cole , a former student and the provost at Columbia , once said , '' If there were a Nobel Prize in sociology , there would be no question he would have gotten it . '' <br><blue>15</blue>( Mr. Merton 's son , Robert C. Merton , won a Nobel Prize in economics in 1997 . ) <br><blue>16</blue>Another of Mr. Merton 's contributions to sociology was his emphasis on what he termed '' theories of the middle range . '' <br><blue>17</blue>By these he meant undertakings that steered clear of grand speculative and abstract doctrines while also avoiding pedantic inquiries that were unlikely to yield significant results . <br><blue>18</blue>What he preferred were initiatives that might yield findings of consequence and that open lines of further inquiry . <br><blue>19</blue>In his own writings he favored the essay form , '' which provides scope for asides and correlatives , '' he said , over the more common and streamlined scientific paper . <br><blue>20</blue>He was often came up with clearly phrased observations that combined originality with seeming simplicity . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>politicians , their handlers , marketers and hucksters</m_str> (9_28) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (9_30) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>it</m_str> (3_19) 	<m_str>his pioneering reputation</m_str> (3_4) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Sociology</m_str> (14_7) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (14_47) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>scientists</m_str> (3_15) 	<m_str>them</m_str> (3_28) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>a Nobel Prize in sociology</m_str> (14_32) 	<m_str>a Nobel Prize</m_str> (15_12) 	<br><blue>6(37)</blue>: <m_str>Mr. Merton 's</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>Robert C.
