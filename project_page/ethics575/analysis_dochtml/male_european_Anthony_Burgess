<blue>1</blue>Anthony Burgess , the prolific British novelist , composer , librettist , essayist , semanticist , translator and critic , whose best-known novel , " A Clockwork Orange , " offered a bleak vision of a violence-ridden future , died yesterday in London Hospital . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 76 and lived in Monaco and Lugano , Switzerland . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause of death was cancer , said a spokeswoman for Hutchinson , his publisher , adding that he had been ill for some time . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Burgess 's versatility and erudition found expression in more than 50 books and dozens of musical compositions , from operas , choral works and song cycles to symphonies and concertos . <br><blue>5</blue>He also wrote radio and television scripts , as well as countless articles for British , American , French and Italian newspapers and magazines . <br><blue>6</blue>In a 1973 interview in The Paris Review about the art of fiction , he said , " The ideal reader of my novels is a lapsed Catholic and failed musician , short-sighted , color-blind , auditorily biased , who has read the books that I have read . " <br><blue>7</blue>" I call myself a professional writer in that I must write in order to eat , and I am not ashamed to belong to the ' Grub Street ' confraternity which Dr. Johnson honored , " he said . <br><blue>8</blue>" But primarily I call myself a serious novelist who is attempting to extend the range of subject matter available to fiction , and a practitioner who is anxious to exploit words much as a poet does . " <br><blue>9</blue>Learned From Sterne and Joyce Mr. Burgess acknowledged that his masters included Laurence Sterne , James Joyce and Evelyn Waugh . <br><blue>10</blue>Tracing the origins of his work and beliefs , he said : " I was brought up a Catholic , became an agnostic , flirted with Islam and now hold a position which may be termed Manichee . <br><blue>11</blue>I believe the wrong God is temporarily ruling the world and that the true God has gone under . <br><blue>12</blue>Thus I am a pessimist but believe the world has much solace to offer : love , food , music , the immense variety of race and language , literature and the pleasure of artistic creation . " <br><blue>13</blue>" A Clockwork Orange " ( 1962 ) tells the story of a murderous , Beethoven-loving teen-age gang leader in a complacent and conformist society in the near future . <br><blue>14</blue>In this welfare state , roving bands of delinquents fight , steal and rape to assert their freedom against the conformity of a clockwork society . <br><blue>15</blue>The novel is written in a dialect of the author 's own invention . <br><blue>16</blue>Its language , called nadsat , is a mixture of English and American slang , Russian , gypsy talk and odd bits of Jacobean prose . <br><blue>17</blue>The movie version of the novel , directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1971 , encountered heavy criticism -- some of its violent scenes were said to have inspired real-life violence by gangs of hoodlums -- and was eventually withdrawn by its producers and distributors . <br><blue>18</blue>To this day , the movie can not be legally shown anywhere in Britain , on either film or videocassette . <br><blue>19</blue>After a High Court ruling last month , however , a television network was able to show clips from the film , which British critics generally found far more violent than the book on which it was based . <br><blue>20</blue>Mr. Burgess once professed surprise about his reputation as a prolific writer of comic novels . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>the wrong God</m_str> (11_3) 	<m_str>the true God</m_str> (11_13) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>the book on which it was based</m_str> (19_32) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the world</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>the world</m_str> (12_8) 	<br><blue>4(1)</blue>: <m_str>Monaco and Lugano , Switzerland</m_str> (2_7) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>a television network</m_str> (19_11) 	<m_str>it</m_str> (19_36) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>my novels</m_str> (6_23) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>James Joyce</m_str> (9_16) 	<m_str>Joyce</m_str> (9_5) 	<br><blue>8(26)</blue>: <m_str>I</m_str> (7_10) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (7_19) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>myself</m_str> (8_6) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (6_46) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_38) 	<m_str>Mr. Burgess</m_str> (9_6) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_10) 	<m_str>Evelyn Waugh</m_str> (9_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (10_14) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_14) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (3_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Burgess 's</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Burgess</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>The ideal reader of my novels</m_str> (6_19) 	<m_str>myself</m_str> (7_4) 	<m_str>my</m_str> (6_23) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>Laurence Sterne , James Joyce and Evelyn Waugh</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>Sterne and Joyce</m_str> (9_3) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>his work</m_str> (10_5) 	<br><blue>11(4)</blue>: <m_str>Its</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (17_21) 	<m_str>the author 's</m_str> (15_9) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (17_41) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
