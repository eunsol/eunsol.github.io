<blue>1</blue>Lew Grade , an immigrant boy from the slums of London 's East End who rose to become Britain 's biggest impresario of popular entertainment , died here today at the age of 91 . <br><blue>2</blue>Founder of Britain 's first commercially financed television company , Lord Grade , who was knighted in 1963 and given a life peerage in 1976 , demonstrated his affinity for the common touch as much with his buoyant personality as with his TV series and movies . <br><blue>3</blue>His balding profile , with a trademark nine-inch cigar clenched in his teeth , inspired the affection that the jowly silhouette of Alfred Hitchcock once did . <br><blue>4</blue>A set piece of London film premieres was Lord Grade emerging in a wreath of smoke from his 1971 Phantom Six Rolls-Royce . <br><blue>5</blue>He demonstrated a talent for reinventing himself , springing back from defeat and dispelling doom with humor . <br><blue>6</blue>When one of his biggest gambles , the $ 30 million movie '' Raise the Titanic , '' sank under the weight of dismissive reviews in 1980 , he famously said , '' It would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic . '' <br><blue>7</blue>Lord Grade , who broke into show business as a champion Charleston dancer in 1926 , was until last month still showing up for 10-hour workdays and lighting the first of his seven daily Monte Cristos in his office at 7:30 A.M . <br><blue>8</blue>He was born in 1906 to Golda and Isaac Winogradsky in the Ukrainian town of Tokmak . <br><blue>9</blue>He was 6 when his Jewish family fled czarist Russia for London . <br><blue>10</blue>At 14 he left school and joined his father in the rag business . <br><blue>11</blue>He pursued dancing to the stage of the Albert Hall where in 1926 he won a contest and became the Charleston Champion of the World . <br><blue>12</blue>For the next five years he worked as a hoofer , performing throughout Europe . <br><blue>13</blue>Water on the knee ended this early career , and in 1934 he embarked on another , joining his brother Leslie in founding the Grade Organization , which became the biggest show business agency in Britain . <br><blue>14</blue>Lord Grade was responsible for booking people like Bob Hope , Jack Benny , Judy Garland , Mario Lanza and Danny Kaye into the London Palladium . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1955 , he founded Associated Television , the first such commercially financed company in Britain , to compete with the British Broadcasting Corporation . <br><blue>16</blue>From the outset , he aimed at providing more lighthearted entertainment than the BBC offerings , and later , when commercial television expanded into serious undertakings , Lord Grade 's end of the business was thought of cozily by Britons as the '' song and dance '' side . <br><blue>17</blue>Associated Television became Associated Communications Corporation , an international group with 5,000 employees and annual turnover of $ 420 million , but he lost control in 1982 in a bitter dispute with the Australian financial entrepreneur Robert Holmes a Court . <br><blue>18</blue>He became chairman and chief executive of Embassy Communications International , the London headquarters of Embassy Communications , a group of entertainment companies based in Los Angeles . <br><blue>19</blue>When Coca-Cola bought Embassy , Lord Grade set up the Grade Company , which was the co-producer of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's '' Starlight Express '' on Broadway . <br><blue>20</blue>He was also elected a vice president of the Loews group of movie theaters . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>1926</m_str> (7_15) 	<m_str>1926</m_str> (11_13) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>Charleston</m_str> (11_21) 	<m_str>Charleston</m_str> (7_12) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>Andrew Lloyd Webber 's</m_str> (19_19) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Embassy Communications</m_str> (18_16) 	<m_str>Embassy</m_str> (19_4) 	<br><blue>5(5)</blue>: <m_str>London</m_str> (9_12) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (14_25) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>London 's</m_str> (1_11) 	<m_str>London</m_str> (18_13) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the business</m_str> (16_33) 	<m_str>the rag business</m_str> (10_11) 	<br><blue>7(28)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (6_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (2_37) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_14) 	<m_str>Alfred Hitchcock</m_str> (3_23) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (2_42) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_32) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (5_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (7_38) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>Founder of Britain 's first commercially financed television company , Lord Grade , who was knighted in 1963 and given a life peerage in 1976</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_19) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_23) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (2_28) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_12) 	<br><blue>8(4)</blue>: <m_str>Britain</m_str> (13_36) 	<m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (1_19) 	<m_str>Britain 's</m_str> (2_3) 	<m_str>Britain</m_str> (15_16) 	<br><blue>9(1)</blue>: <m_str>his Jewish family</m_str> (9_5) 	<br><blue>10(3)</blue>: <m_str>Lord Grade</m_str> (14_1) 	<m_str>Lord Grade</m_str> (19_6) 	<m_str>Lord Grade 's</m_str> (16_28) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Titanic , '' sank under the weight of dismissive reviews in 1980</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (6_34) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
