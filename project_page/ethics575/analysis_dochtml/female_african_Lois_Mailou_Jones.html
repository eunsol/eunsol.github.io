<blue>1</blue>Lois Mailou Jones , an American painter and an art teacher for almost a half century at Howard University in Washington , died at her home in Washington on Tuesday . <br><blue>2</blue>She was 92 . <br><blue>3</blue>Ms. Jones was an iconic figure , and an important historic link in a path-breaking generation of black American artists . <br><blue>4</blue>Her eclectic , academic work , in a career spanning nearly 70 years , ranged from impressionistic landscapes to political allegories , and from cubistic depictions of African sculptures to realistic portraits . <br><blue>5</blue>She was influential as a teacher , not only for her exacting standards and the encouragement she gave students , but as an example of persistence in a climate unfavorable to black and women artists . <br><blue>6</blue>Ms. Jones was born in Boston in 1905 . <br><blue>7</blue>Her mother was a beautician , her father a building superintendent who became a lawyer . <br><blue>8</blue>In high school she took evening drawing classes at Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts and she had her first solo show at 17 on Martha 's Vineyard in Massachusetts . <br><blue>9</blue>There she met the sculptor Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller , one of the first artists to use black and African subjects positively , who encouraged her ambitions . <br><blue>10</blue>After graduate study in art and design in Boston , and then a stint teaching art at Palmer Memorial Institute in Sedalia , N.C. , Ms. Jones joined the faculty of Howard University in 1930 . <br><blue>11</blue>The next year , her work was included in the biennial exhibition of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington . <br><blue>12</blue>It was the first of several appearances at the Corcoran and in other group shows , though Ms. Jones said that early on she asked white friends to deliver her paintings to exhibitions , after having had an award rescinded when it was discovered that she was black . <br><blue>13</blue>In 1934 , while attending a summer session at Columbia University , she was exposed to the cultural life of Harlem , and began studying the African masks that would become central to her best-known paintings . <br><blue>14</blue>In 1937 , she received a fellowship to travel to Europe . <br><blue>15</blue>She studied in Paris for a year and produced one of her most widely exhibited paintings , '' Les Fetiches '' ( 1938 ) , an image of five African masks rendered in a modernist style . <br><blue>16</blue>The work has become an emblem of black American self-identity and is on view in the exhibition '' Rhapsodies in Black : Art of the Harlem Renaissance '' at the Corcoran Gallery , where a small memorial show of the artist 's work has been organized . <br><blue>17</blue>After marrying the Haitian artist Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noel in 1953 , Ms. Jones visited Haiti frequently , and in the 1960 's and ' 70 's she traveled in Africa . <br><blue>18</blue>There she interviewed contemporary artists as part of a project sponsored by Howard University titled '' The Black Visual Artists , '' for which she also documented the work of artists in the Caribbean and the United States . <br><blue>19</blue>Both Haitian and African themes were crucial to her work . <br><blue>20</blue>Throughout these years , Ms. Jones taught at Howard University and elsewhere . <br><hr><br><blue>1(6)</blue>: <m_str>Her eclectic , academic work , in a career spanning nearly 70 years</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>her work</m_str> (11_5) 	<m_str>it</m_str>
