<blue>1</blue>Lewis D. Gilbert , an advocate of shareowner rights and one of the first gadflies to speak out at annual meetings on behalf of small stockholders , died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 86 and lived in Manhattan . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause of death was a heart ailment , said his brother , John J. , who worked with Lewis for 40 years in publishing an annual compendium of stockholder activities at corporate meetings . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Gilbert , who attended 100 or more annual meetings for more than 50 years , fought to bring what he called corporate democracy to major American corporations . <br><blue>5</blue>By persistently questioning chief executive officers -- some of them considered it badgering -- he succeeded in getting more companies to hold annual meetings in accessible locations , to issue post-meeting reports , to limit stock options for executives and to require their auditors to attend the meetings . ' <br><blue>6</blue>A Lonely Voice ' " A lot of the ideas that the Gilberts pushed for for many years to make boards accountable to shareholders have become real , " said James E. Heard , the president of Institutional Shareholder Services , which advises large institutions on voting at annual meetings . <br><blue>7</blue>" They were a lonely voice out there for a long time and a lot of what they were saying has relevance today . " <br><blue>8</blue>Lewis Dusenberry Gilbert , who was financially independent as a result of inheritances from his parents and grandparents , was born in Palo Alto , Calif . <br><blue>9</blue>He worked briefly as a reporter for weekly newspapers in the New York metropolitan area . <br><blue>10</blue>In 1933 , he went to his first annual meeting at the Consolidated Gas Company , which later became part of Consolidated Edison . <br><blue>11</blue>" I expected to be welcomed cordially and to be treated like one of the owners , " he later said . <br><blue>12</blue>" I got up to ask a question , but before I had a chance to say anything , one of the officers sitting in the back of the room made a motion to adjourn . " <br><blue>13</blue>As a result of that experience , Mr. Gilbert undertook a crusade to make corporate executives more responsive to the stockholders who owned their corporations . <br><blue>14</blue>Despite being cold-shouldered by many managements and hissed by some other shareholders , he continued to appear regularly at annual meetings to voice his views . <br><blue>15</blue>He attended his last annual meetings in 1992 . <br><blue>16</blue>Small Blocks of Stock At the peak of his influence , Mr. Gilbert , with his family , owned relatively small blocks of stock in about 1,500 corporations . <br><blue>17</blue>He once said that he and his brother live on " dividends and interest -- just like everyone else . " <br><blue>18</blue>Mr. Gilbert 's very appearance at an annual meeeting often had an upsetting effect on many chief executives , including one who told him to " drop dead " and another who threatened him with a punch in the nose . <br><blue>19</blue>The motions he proposed from the floor were frequently defeated , but he also won victories on such matters as updated accounting procedures and cumulative voting for directors . <br><blue>20</blue>Mr. Gilbert , who was an Army corporal in World War II , did battle with Generals Douglas MacArthur and Lucius D. Clay when he discovered that they did not own shares of companies of which they were directors , Remington Rand and Marine Midland . <br><hr><br><blue>1(1)</blue>: <m_str>their corporations</m_str> (13_24) 	<br><blue>2(1)</blue>: <m_str>New York</m_str> (9_12) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>they</m_str> (20_28) 	<m_str>Generals Douglas MacArthur and Lucius D.
