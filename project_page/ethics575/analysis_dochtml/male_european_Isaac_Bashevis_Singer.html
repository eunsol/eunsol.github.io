<blue>1</blue>Isaac Bashevis Singer , whose vivid evocations of Jewish life in his native Poland and of his experiences as an immigrant in America won him the Nobel Prize in Literature , died on Wednesday . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 87 years old and lived in Surfside , Fla . <br><blue>3</blue>Mr. Singer died after several strokes , said his wife , Alma . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. Singer 's stories and novels , written in Yiddish , often dealt with his upbringing as a rabbi 's son in Warsaw and in a small town in eastern Poland and were redolent of the mysticism of Jewish folklore . <br><blue>5</blue>But he also wrote about loneliness in drab cafeterias , worldliness in Miami Beach and chance acquaintanceship on the sidewalks of upper Broadway . <br><blue>6</blue>Throughout his career , he wrote about passions and high emotions . <br><blue>7</blue>" God gave us so many emotions and such strong ones , " he once said in an interview . <br><blue>8</blue>" Every human being , even if he is an idiot , is a millionaire in emotions . " <br><blue>9</blue>Even after decades in the United States Mr. Singer kept using Yiddish for his long succession of short stories , novels , memoirs and children 's books . <br><blue>10</blue>Most of his fiction first appeared in Yiddish in The Jewish Daily Forward , a newspaper in New York City that is now The Jewish Forward . <br><blue>11</blue>It has had an English-language sister publication since last year . <br><blue>12</blue>But Mr. Singer 's writing reached a large international public through translations into English and many other languages . <br><blue>13</blue>Its worldwide appeal was noted in the citation that accompanied his Nobel Prize in 1978 . <br><blue>14</blue>The citation praised his " impassioned narratives , which , with roots in a Polish-Jewish cultural tradition , bring universal human conditions to life . " <br><blue>15</blue>Evoking the General From the Particular The New York Times critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote that this was " another way of saying what admirers have always observed about Singer : that he has made of the East European Jew an exemplar of the suffering modern man who has been exiled from his divine inheritance . " <br><blue>16</blue>Mr. Singer 's more than 30 books ranged from the novel " Satan in Goray , " which came out in 1935 , to another novel , " Scum , " which was serialized in The Jewish Daily Forward in 1967 and published in book form this year . <br><blue>17</blue>They include " A Crown of Feathers " ( 1973 ) and other short-story collections . <br><blue>18</blue>Many of his stories also appeared in The New Yorker . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Singer was a modest man with an unassuming and unliterary style of life : he liked to wear plain business suits and he preferred dairy restaurants to writers ' bars . <br><blue>20</blue>But his life was enlivened by his passion for metaphysics , his eye for a pretty ankle and his occasional flair for the dramatic ; when he gave his Nobel Prize lecture in December 1978 , he startled the dignitaries in the Stockholm auditorium by breaking into Yiddish . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>short stories</m_str> (9_18) 	<m_str>his stories</m_str> (18_3) 	<br><blue>2(35)</blue>: <m_str>Isaac Bashevis Singer</m_str> (1_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_17) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (1_25) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Singer</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (3_9) 	<m_str>Alma</m_str> (3_12) 	<m_str>Mr. Singer 's</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (4_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (6_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (6_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (7_14) 	<m_str>Mr. Singer</m_str> (9_8) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (10_3) 	<m_str>Mr. Singer 's writing</m_str> (12_2) 	<m_str>Singer 's</m_str> (12_3) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (13_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (14_4) 	<m_str>Singer</m_str> (15_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (15_32) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_52) 	<m_str>Mr. Singer 's</m_str> (16_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Singer</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_16) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_24) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_2) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_7) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_12) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_27) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_29) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (20_37) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>the Nobel Prize in Literature</m_str> (1_26) 	<m_str>his Nobel Prize</m_str> (13_11) 	<br><blue>4(3)</blue>: <m_str>a newspaper in New York City that is now The Jewish Forward</m_str> (10_15) 	<m_str>It</m_str> (11_1) 	<m_str>Its</m_str> (13_1) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>the citation that accompanied his Nobel Prize in 1978</m_str> (13_7) 	<m_str>The citation</m_str> (14_1) 	<br><blue>6(1)</blue>: <m_str>Warsaw</m_str> (4_23) 	<br><blue>7(1)</blue>: <m_str>the United States</m_str> (9_5) 	<br><blue>8(2)</blue>: <m_str>God</m_str> (7_2) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_8) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>The Jewish Daily</m_str> (10_10) 	<m_str>The Jewish Daily</m_str> (16_36) 	<br><blue>10(1)</blue>: <m_str>eastern Poland</m_str> (4_30) 	<br><blue>11(2)</blue>: <m_str>last year</m_str> (11_9) 	<m_str>this year</m_str> (16_47) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
