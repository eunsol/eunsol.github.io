<blue>1</blue>Francis A. O'Neill Jr. , who played a leading role in settling major airline and railroad strikes as a longtime member and chairman of the National Mediation Board , died Tuesday at Martin Memorial Hospital in Stuart , Fla. , where he was visiting . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 83 years old and lived in Manasquan , N.J . <br><blue>3</blue>He died of natural causes , the funeral home said . <br><blue>4</blue>Mr. O'Neill 's 24-year tenure on the board , from 1947 to 1971 , was the longest in its history . <br><blue>5</blue>First appointed by President Harry S. Truman in 1947 , he was retained by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower , John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson . <br><blue>6</blue>Mr. O'Neill was a Republican , and the law bars the three-member board from having more than two members of the same party . <br><blue>7</blue>Mr. O'Neill was chairman of the board at various times for a total of nine years , under an arrangement rotating the position among the members . <br><blue>8</blue>Carrying out the agency 's oversight of airline and railroad labor relations , he often raced across the country from one crisis to the next , coaxing negotiators into agreeing on new contracts . <br><blue>9</blue>More than 90 percent of the disputes handled by the board were resolved without strikes during his membership . <br><blue>10</blue>' True Professional ' " He was a true professional , apolitical completely and dedicated to settling disputes , " said Theodore W. Kheel , a mediator who worked with Mr. O'Neill in a 10-day negotiating session at the White House in 1964 at the behest of President Johnson . <br><blue>11</blue>The talks resolved issues that had troubled the railroads for years . <br><blue>12</blue>Trusted by both management and union officials , Mr. O'Neill was usually easy-going and modest . <br><blue>13</blue>" There 's never been a mediator who lived who settled a dispute , " he once said . <br><blue>14</blue>" The parties always settle their own dispute . <br><blue>15</blue>All you can do is suggest and keep using your imagination to come up with new alternatives . " <br><blue>16</blue>But he admitted occasionally losing patience , as when a Long Island Rail Road strike dragged on for nearly a month in 1960 . <br><blue>17</blue>" I told 'em where to get off , " he would say later . <br><blue>18</blue>" We had a settlement about an hour later . " <br><blue>19</blue>Another time he cajoled bargainers by complaining , " You people are really getting me to the point where I 'm going to get sick any minute . " <br><blue>20</blue>Born in Brooklyn , Mr. O'Neill grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Fordham University in 1929 and its law school in 1932 . <br><hr><br><blue>1(3)</blue>: <m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_42) 	<br><blue>2(17)</blue>: <m_str>he</m_str> (5_11) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (17_2) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Neill 's</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_3) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Neill</m_str> (6_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_17) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Neill in a 10-day negotiating session</m_str> (10_31) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_16) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (10_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_2) 	<m_str>me</m_str> (19_15) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (8_14) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Neill</m_str> (12_9) 	<m_str>I</m_str> (19_20) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Neill</m_str> (7_1) 	<m_str>Mr. O'Neill</m_str> (20_5) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>their own dispute</m_str> (14_6) 	<m_str>a dispute</m_str> (13_12) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>The parties</m_str> (14_2) 	<m_str>their</m_str> (14_6) 	<br><blue>5(2)</blue>: <m_str>you</m_str> (15_2) 	<m_str>your</m_str> (15_10) 	<br><blue>6(2)</blue>: <m_str>the members</m_str> (7_25) 	<m_str>more than two members of the same party</m_str> (6_16) 	<br><blue>7(2)</blue>: <m_str>President Johnson</m_str> (10_48) 	<m_str>Lyndon B.
