<blue>1</blue>Mario Giacomelli , the Italian photographer perhaps best known for his joyous pictures of young priests reveling in a snowfall , died on Nov. 25 at home in Senigallia , a small town on the shores of the Adriatic Sea , where he had lived all his life and whose farmlands and people were the subjects of his spare , often darkly expressionist work . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 75 . <br><blue>3</blue>The cause was cancer , said Davide Faccioli of the Galleria Photology in Milan , who represents him . <br><blue>4</blue>A self-taught photographer , Mr. Giacomelli had a poet 's eye for the startlingly abstract order man can impose on nature and a poet 's understanding of the great disorder that is the human condition . <br><blue>5</blue>Among his memorable images is one sometimes known as '' The Scanno Boy , '' part of the 1957-59 series of pictures that Mr. Giacomelli took in Scanno , an impoverished town in the Abruzzi region of central Italy . <br><blue>6</blue>Framed by elderly women in black , the boy is set apart by what John Szarkowski , former director of the department of photography at the Museum of Modern Art , has described as '' the halo of the worn footpath . '' <br><blue>7</blue>With all the faces blurred except for the boy 's , the picture is dreamlike and in its stark dichotomy -- youth surrounded by old age -- could almost be a reprise of the artist 's boyhood . <br><blue>8</blue>Mr. Giacomelli was born on Aug. 1 , 1925 , in a part of Italy whose old ways were passed from generation to generation . <br><blue>9</blue>His father died when he was 9 ; his mother worked at Senigallia 's home for the aged and the young Mario often accompanied her there . <br><blue>10</blue>When he was 13 he became an apprentice in typography . <br><blue>11</blue>As a young man , he worked as a typographer , painting on weekends and writing poetry . <br><blue>12</blue>Inspired by the wartime movies of filmmakers like Fellini , Mr. Giacomelli taught himself still photography and found his art in the generally impoverished countryside . <br><blue>13</blue>Serendipitously , the Italian photographer Giuseppe Cavalli had moved to Senigallia and was eager to form a club that would promote photography as art . <br><blue>14</blue>In 1953 the Misa club was formed , with its officers including Cavalli as president and Mr. Giacomelli as treasurer . <br><blue>15</blue>In 1954 Mr. Giacomelli began to photograph the home for the elderly where his mother had worked , completing the series in 1983 . <br><blue>16</blue>Empathetic but grittily unsentimental , the pictures show many women seemingly marooned in the sea of old age . <br><blue>17</blue>In 1985-87 , Mr. Giacomelli revisited the subject for his series '' Ninna Nanna , '' which means lullaby . <br><blue>18</blue>This time , the deeply lined , gaunt faces of the aged are a bleak counterpoint to the bold lines and patterns found in the fields and on the sides of houses . <br><blue>19</blue>Mr. Giacomelli 's overhead views of mystifyingly abstract , horizonless landscapes , which he took from the time he snapped his first pictures , in late 1952 , through the 1990 's , place him in the company of photographers like William Garnett and Minor White . <br><blue>20</blue>Mr. Giacomelli 's 1970 's images of geometric patterns in Senigallia 's fields bear striking parallels to Aaron Siskind 's contemporaneous photographs of wall abstractions . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>a poet 's</m_str> (4_23) 	<m_str>a poet 's</m_str> (4_8) 	<br><blue>2(3)</blue>: <m_str>the picture</m_str> (7_12) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (7_18) 	<m_str>the artist 's</m_str> (7_34) 	<br><blue>3(3)</blue>: <m_str>Senigallia 's</m_str> (9_13) 	<m_str>Senigallia</m_str> (1_29) 	<m_str>Senigallia 's</m_str> (20_11) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Senigallia 's fields</m_str> (20_11) 	<m_str>the fields</m_str> (18_25) 	<br><blue>5(1)</blue>: <m_str>Milan</m_str> (3_14) 	<br><blue>6(3)</blue>: <m_str>the Misa club</m_str> (14_3) 	<m_str>its</m_str> (14_10) 	<m_str>a club that would promote photography as art</m_str> (13_17) 	<br><blue>7(37)</blue>: <m_str>the boy 's</m_str> (7_8) 	<m_str>Mr. Giacomelli as treasurer</m_str> (14_17) 	<m_str>Mr. Giacomelli</m_str> (15_3) 	<m_str>Mr. Giacomelli</m_str> (8_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (15_14) 	<m_str>His</m_str> (9_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_11) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Giacomelli</m_str> (17_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (17_10) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_2) 	<m_str>the young Mario</m_str> (9_20) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (1_43) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_47) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_6) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (3_18) 	<m_str>Mr. Giacomelli 's</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Mr. Giacomelli</m_str> (4_5) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (1_58) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_14) 	<m_str>the startlingly abstract order man</m_str> (4_13) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_19) 	<m_str>Mr. Giacomelli 's</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (5_2) 	<m_str>Mr. Giacomelli</m_str> (12_11) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (19_21) 	<m_str>himself</m_str> (12_14) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (12_19) 	<m_str>'' The Scanno Boy</m_str> (5_10) 	<m_str>the Italian photographer Giuseppe Cavalli</m_str> (13_3) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (19_35) 	<m_str>Mr. Giacomelli</m_str> (5_24) 	<m_str>the boy</m_str> (6_8) 	<m_str>Cavalli</m_str> (14_13) 	<br><blue>8(1)</blue>: <m_str>his first pictures</m_str> (19_21) 	<br><blue>9(2)</blue>: <m_str>his mother</m_str> (9_9) 	<m_str>his mother</m_str> (15_14) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
