<blue>1</blue>Efraim Racker , a leading researcher on energy storage in living cells and its implications for cancer , died on Monday at University Hospital in Syracuse . <br><blue>2</blue>He was 78 years old and lived in Ithaca . <br><blue>3</blue>He died of a stroke , said a spokeswoman for Cornell University , where Dr. Racker was on the faculty . <br><blue>4</blue>Dr. Racker 's research earned him the National Medal of Science , awarded by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 . <br><blue>5</blue>He had also been a member of a cancer advisory board to the National Cancer Institute and chairman of the biochemistry study section at the National Institutes of Health . <br><blue>6</blue>For the last 25 years , Dr. Racker was the Albert Einstein professor of biochemistry at Cornell , one of 10 chairs endowed by the State Legislature to attract eminent scholars to New York . <br><blue>7</blue>He was the chairman of the biochemistry and molecular biology department at Cornell from 1966 to 1970 . <br><blue>8</blue>In 1959 , Dr. Racker and fellow researchers found that cancer cells have 10 times as much sugar-fermenting enzymes as do undiseased cells , causing a critical imbalance of lactic acid , which was believed to play a role in the proliferation of cancer cells . <br><blue>9</blue>In 1976 , he and Dr. Walther Stoeckenius reported their discovery of how an unusual bacterium that thrives in salt converts sunlight into chemical energy by passing protons through its membranes . <br><blue>10</blue>More recently , he was researching signals that trigger cell activity . <br><blue>11</blue>Fled Nazi Occupation Dr. Racker was born in Poland and grew up in Austria , where he received his medical degree from the University of Vienna in 1938 . <br><blue>12</blue>A Jew , he fled the Nazi occupation and went to South Wales to study brain metabolism at the Cardiff City Mental Hospital from 1938 to 1940 . <br><blue>13</blue>Over the next two years , at the University of Minnesota , he researched the effects of the poliomyelitis virus on the brain . <br><blue>14</blue>Then , from 1942 to 1944 , he was a resident in pneumonia at Harlem Hospital in New York City . <br><blue>15</blue>Dr. Racker also taught microbiology at the New York University College of Medicine from 1944 to 1952 . <br><blue>16</blue>For the next two years he was a biochemistry professor at the Yale University School of Medicine . <br><blue>17</blue>From 1954 to 1966 he was chief of the nutrition and physiology division of the Public Health Research Institute of New York . <br><blue>18</blue>Dr. Racker wrote or co-wrote hundreds of scientific papers . <br><blue>19</blue>He also painted portraits and abstracts and held a number of exhibitions , the proceeds from which he donated to cancer research . <br><blue>20</blue>Dr. Racker is survived by his wife , Dr. Franziska Racker ; a daughter , Dr. Ann Costello , and three grandchildren , all of Ithaca , and a sister , Miriam Racker of Haifa , Israel . <br><hr><br><blue>1(2)</blue>: <m_str>biochemistry at Cornell , one of 10 chairs endowed by the State Legislature to attract eminent scholars to New York</m_str> (6_15) 	<m_str>the biochemistry</m_str> (7_6) 	<br><blue>2(2)</blue>: <m_str>the next two years</m_str> (13_2) 	<m_str>the next two years</m_str> (16_2) 	<br><blue>3(2)</blue>: <m_str>Ithaca</m_str> (2_9) 	<m_str>Ithaca</m_str> (20_26) 	<br><blue>4(2)</blue>: <m_str>Cornell</m_str> (7_13) 	<m_str>Cornell , one of 10 chairs endowed by the State Legislature to attract eminent scholars to New York</m_str> (6_17) 	<br><blue>5(26)</blue>: <m_str>Nazi Occupation Dr. Racker</m_str> (11_2) 	<m_str>Dr. Racker</m_str> (15_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Racker</m_str> (3_15) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (19_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Racker 's</m_str> (4_1) 	<m_str>him</m_str> (4_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (11_17) 	<m_str>Dr. Racker</m_str> (8_4) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (11_19) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (12_4) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (19_18) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (5_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (16_6) 	<m_str>Dr. Racker</m_str> (20_1) 	<m_str>his</m_str> (20_6) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (9_4) 	<m_str>Dr. Franziska Racker</m_str> (20_9) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (2_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (17_5) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (13_13) 	<m_str>Dr. Racker</m_str> (6_7) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (10_4) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (3_1) 	<m_str>Dr. Racker</m_str> (18_1) 	<m_str>he</m_str> (14_8) 	<m_str>He</m_str> (7_1) 	<hr><br> gender:male	ethnicity:european<br>         </p>
