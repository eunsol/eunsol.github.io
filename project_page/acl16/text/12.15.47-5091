<blue>1</blue>Canadarm2 lays track for space railway SubHead : ' A unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment ' : Improved mobility Author : <e2>Broward </e2><e2>Liston </e2><e2>CAPE </e2><e2>CANAVERAL </e2>, <e4>Fla. </e4>- The first railway in outer space was ready to roll yesterday after astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis prepped it for its inaugural run . <br><blue>2</blue>The rail car , installed outside the <e5>International </e5><e5>Space </e5><e5>Station </e5>on the crew 's first spacewalk , will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second , but ground controllers may not open up the throttle all the way in their first test today anyway . <br><blue>3</blue>The rail car is part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss , the centerpiece of what is to be a 120-metre girder running the length of the space station . <br><blue>4</blue>The completed girder will support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for use throughout the station . <br><blue>5</blue>In a spacewalk lasting more than six hours , astronauts <e11>Steve </e11><e11>Smith </e11>and <e10>Rex </e10><e10>Walheim </e10>, the same team that mounted the new truss segment on to the station last Thursday , released launch restraints on the rail car , which rode to space in the shuttle 's cargo bay . <br><blue>6</blue><e9>NASA </e9>said the Mobile Transporter , as the rail car is officially known , was ready for its first test today . <br><blue>7</blue>`` As far as speed is concerned , <e9><eC>it </eC></e9>'s probably going to be in the fractions of an inch velocity -- on the order of a tenth of an inch per second , '' said <e0>Ben </e0><e0>Sellari </e0>, <e0><eC>the </eC></e0><e0><eC>launch </eC></e0><e0><eC>package </eC></e0><e0><eC>manager </eC></e0><e0><eC>at </eC></e0><e0><eC>Mission </eC></e0><e8>Mission </e8><e0><eC>Control </eC></e0><e8>Control </e8>. <br><blue>8</blue>The small trolley is designed to roll the station 's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another as work progresses on the station over the next several years . <br><blue>9</blue>Captain <e7>Marc </e7><e7>Garneau </e7>, president of the <e3>Canadian </e3><e3>Space </e3><e3>Agency </e3>, said Canadarm2 has so far performed flawlessly in its pivotal role installing the truss segment . <br><blue>10</blue>The massive robotic arm , <e3>Canada </e3>'s contribution to the multi-national space station , lifted the truss segment out and away from the shuttle 's cargo bay and attached it on the station 's laboratory module . <br><blue>11</blue>The arm was then used for the first time to move the spacewalking astronauts to different work sites around the newly installed truss . <br><blue>12</blue>Teams of engineers from the <e3>CSA </e3>and <e6>MD </e6><e6>Robotics </e6>, the <e1>Brampton-based </e1>company that built the arm , were monitoring <e6><eC>its </eC></e6>work closely from the ground . <br><blue>13</blue>An anomaly was detected on one of its joints several weeks ago , but the <e3>Canadian </e3>engineers successfully bypassed the problem area . <br><blue>14</blue>`` Canadarm2 is a unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment , '' said Capt. <e7>Garneau </e7>. <br><blue>15</blue>`` Problems are bound to occur and are part of the normal course of space activities ... -LSB- but -RSB- Canadarm2 operations went smoothly and flawlessly yesterday .
