<blue>1</blue>Veni , <e6>Vidi </e6>, Venezuela FIGHTING tyranny with tyranny clearly did n't work in oil-giant <e5>Venezuela </e5>last week . <br><blue>2</blue>And now coup-plotting military officers and <e2><eC>the </eC></e2><e2><eC>reinstalled </eC></e2><e2><eC>president </eC></e2>, <e2>Hugo </e2><e2>Chavez </e2>, need to show <e3>Latin </e3><e3>America </e3>that their tyrannical tactics are at an end . <br><blue>3</blue><e2><eC>President </eC></e2><e2><eC>Chavez </eC></e2><e2><eC>- </eC></e2><e2><eC>a </eC></e2><e2><eC>former </eC></e2><e0>Army </e0><e2><eC>coup-meister </eC></e2><e2><eC>himself </eC></e2><e2><eC>, </eC></e2><e2><eC>who </eC></e2><e2><eC>was </eC></e2><e2><eC>elected </eC></e2><e2><eC>three </eC></e2><e2><eC>years </eC></e2><e2><eC>ago </eC></e2><e2><eC>- </eC></e2>has abused <e2><eC>his </eC></e2>popular mandate with heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution largely rewritten by <e2><eC>himself </eC></e2>and <e2><eC>his </eC></e2>supporters . <br><blue>4</blue><e2><eC>He </eC></e2>has sometimes talked of remaining president past the year 2020 . <br><blue>5</blue>And <e2><eC>his </eC></e2>economic promises to the poor are in shreds , while <e2><eC>his </eC></e2>diplomatic flirtation with leftist world dictators only hints at <e2><eC>his </eC></e2>inclinations to gain more power . <br><blue>6</blue>But <e3>Latin </e3><e3>America </e3>has moved beyond coups , and this pivotal nation in a hemisphere of democracies has the means to remove <e2><eC>Mr. </eC></e2><e2><eC>Chavez </eC></e2>by constitutional and especially nonviolent means . <br><blue>7</blue><e2><eC>His </eC></e2>two-day removal from office began when <e2><eC>he </eC></e2>tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in <e2><eC>his </eC></e2>favor . <br><blue>8</blue>The company 's executives revolted , threatening a cutoff of oil . <br><blue>9</blue>That was a catalyst for pent-up opposition to <e2>Chavez </e2>. <br><blue>10</blue>Business groups and labor unions joined in a giant protest , perhaps knowing that portions of the military were on their side . <br><blue>11</blue>When gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace last Thursday , killing more than a dozen , military leaders forced <e2>Chavez </e2>to step aside . <br><blue>12</blue>But then international pressure and renewed domestic support for <e2>Chavez </e2>forced the generals to let <e2><eC>him </eC></e2>take office again . <br><blue>13</blue>The <e1>Bush </e1>administration all but welcomed the coup , tarnishing the <e4>US </e4>role as a champion of democracy . <br><blue>14</blue>It , too , has a reason to repent . <br><blue>15</blue>Copyright @ 2002 The Christian Science Monitor . <br></div>
