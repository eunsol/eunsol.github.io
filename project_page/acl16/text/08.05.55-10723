'' <br><blue>4</blue><e13><eC>Mr. </eC></e13><e13><eC>Rumsfeld </eC></e13>spoke in an unusual briefing that stretched over an hour in an attempt , <e13><eC>he </eC></e13>said , to `` tap down some of this hyperbole . '' <br><blue>5</blue>It was prompted by a rising tide of international criticism after <e5><eC>the </eC></e5><e5><eC>Defense </eC></e5><e5><eC>Department </eC></e5>released photographs over the weekend that showed some of the prisoners kneeling before their captors , their legs in shackles , their hands bound in manacles , their mouths covered by surgical masks and their eyes blinded by large goggles with black tape . <br><blue>6</blue><e13><eC>His </eC></e13>comments came as criticism swelled from abroad . <br><blue>7</blue>Critics said the <e15>United </e15><e15>States </e15>was using sensory deprivation and other psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners so that interrogations would be more fruitful . <br><blue>8</blue>The <e9>International </e9><e9>Committee </e9>of the <e12>Red </e12><e12>Cross </e12>, in a rare break with <e12><eC>its </eC></e12>code of not publicly criticizing detaining governments , said the <e15>United </e15><e15>States </e15>might have violated Geneva Convention rules against making a spectacle of prisoners by distributing the pictures , which were published worldwide . <br><blue>9</blue><e1>Amnesty </e1><e1>International </e1>sought access to the prisoners in <e7>Guantanamo </e7>and said they should be allowed to have lawyers . <br><blue>10</blue>`` Keeping prisoners incommunicado , sensory deprivation , the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them are all classic techniques employed to break the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation , '' the organization said . <br><blue>11</blue>Several governments joined the chorus , saying the prisoners should be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention . <br><blue>12</blue>Such status would accord them the highest level of protections . <br><blue>13</blue><e10>Javier </e10><e10>Solana </e10>, <e10><eC>the </eC></e10><e6>European </e6><e10><eC>European </eC></e10><e6>Union </e6><e10><eC>Union </eC></e10><e10><eC>foreign </eC></e10><e10><eC>policy </eC></e10><e10><eC>chief </eC></e10>, said that despite the Sept. 11 atrocities , `` changing our values and our way of life would be terrorism 's first victory . '' <br><blue>14</blue>The <e11>Netherlands </e11>also urged <e16>Washington </e16>to recognize the detainees as prisoners of war , saying , `` In the fight , we need to uphold our norms and values . '' <br><blue>15</blue>While debate raged elsewhere , <e2>Britain </e2>and <e14>Spain </e14>supported the <e15>United </e15><e15>States </e15>. <br></div>
