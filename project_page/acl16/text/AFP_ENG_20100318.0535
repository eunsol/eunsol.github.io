<blue>1</blue><e2>China </e2>lashes out at <e8>US </e8><e5>House </e5>resolution on <e4>Falungong </e4>. <br><blue>2</blue><e2>China </e2>on Thursday lashed out at a <e8>US </e8><e5>House </e5><e5>of </e5><e5>Representatives </e5>resolution that urged <e0>Beijing </e0>to end <e0><eC>its </eC></e0>`` persecution '' of the outlawed Falungong spiritual group . <br><blue>3</blue>`` The <e8>US </e8><e5>House </e5><e5>of </e5><e5>Representatives </e5>passed a so-called resolution on <e4><eC>Falungong </eC></e4>which made groundless accusations and confuses right and wrong , '' foreign ministry spokesman <e6>Qin </e6><e6>Gang </e6>told reporters . <br><blue>4</blue>`` <e2>China </e2>is firmly against such a resolution . '' <br><blue>5</blue>The <e5>House </e5>voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to call on <e2>China </e2>to free thousands of members of the movement who are said to be imprisoned and to abolish a government office tasked with fighting <e4><eC>the </eC></e4><e4><eC>Falungong </eC></e4>. <br><blue>6</blue>The resolution , which is not legally binding , asked <e2>China </e2>to `` immediately cease and desist from its campaign to persecute , intimidate , imprison and torture Falungong practitioners . '' <br><blue>7</blue>Falungong -- loosely based on <e1>Buddhist </e1>, <e7>Taoist </e7>and <e3>Confucian </e3>philosophies -- enjoyed growing popularity among <e2>Chinese </e2>in the 1990s . <br><blue>8</blue><e2><eC>China </eC></e2><e2><eC>'s </eC></e2>communist government banned the movement in 1999 and later branded it an `` evil cult '' after thousands of practitioners silently converged in <e0>Beijing </e0>to air their grievances , showing their organisational might . <br><blue>9</blue>`` <e4><eC>Falungong </eC></e4>is an anti-human , anti-society and anti-science cult , '' <e6>Qin </e6>said . <br><blue>10</blue>`` The <e2>Chinese </e2>government outlawed the cult according to law . <br><blue>11</blue>We hope the <e8>US </e8>congressmen recognise the nature of the cult and stop interfering in <e2><eC>China </eC></e2><e2><eC>'s </eC></e2>internal affairs .
