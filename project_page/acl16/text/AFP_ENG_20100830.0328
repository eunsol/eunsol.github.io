<blue>1</blue><e6>Obama </e6>hails <e5><eC>New </eC></e5><e5><eC>Orleans </eC></e5><e5><eC>` </eC></e5><e5><eC>resilience </eC></e5><e5><eC>' </eC></e5>five years post-Katrina . <br><blue>2</blue><e1>US </e1><e6><eC>President </eC></e6><e6><eC>Barack </eC></e6><e6><eC>Obama </eC></e6>, marking the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in <e5>New </e5><e5>Orleans </e5>Sunday , praised the city 's resilience and pledged support for rebuilding `` until the job is done . '' <br><blue>3</blue><e6><eC>He </eC></e6>acknowledged that the famed jazz city , where at least 1,500 people died in the storm and its aftermath , was still in need of support , but said community efforts had ensured `` <e5>New </e5><e5>Orleans </e5>is blossoming once more . '' <br><blue>4</blue>`` Together , we are helping to make <e5>New </e5><e5>Orleans </e5>a place that stands for what we can do in <e1>America </e1>, not just for what we ca n't do , '' <e6><eC>he </eC></e6>said in a speech at the city 's <e7>Xavier </e7><e7>University </e7>. <br><blue>5</blue><e6>Obama </e6>acknowledged that the storm , which brought waves of water that overcame levees carrying homes and residents away , `` was a natural disaster , but also a manmade catastrophe , a shameful breakdown in government . '' <br><blue>6</blue>But <e6><eC>he </eC></e6>pledged that the region , struggling with the long-term effects of the tragedy , the economic downturn and , most recently the <e2>Gulf </e2><e2>of </e2><e2>Mexico </e2>oil spill , would be able to rely on the administration for support . <br><blue>7</blue>`` <e6><eC>My </eC></e6>administration is going to stand with you -- and fight alongside you -- until the job is done , '' <e6><eC>he </eC></e6>told a cheering crowd . <br><blue>8</blue>Long famed for its rich music scene and its easy-going spirit , <e5>New </e5><e5>Orleans </e5>was plunged into chaos on August 29 , 2005 when torrents of water broke through barriers and gushed in . <br><blue>9</blue>Although 1.4 million residents and visitors were ordered to evacuate as the monster storm approached , many could not or would not and were left stranded . <br><blue>10</blue>A lack of preparation and bungled coordination forced residents to take shelter in attics , and then break through their roofs to escape rising water . <br><blue>11</blue>Footage of desperate <e1>Americans </e1>, waving signs reading `` Help Us , '' horrified people at home and abroad . <br><blue>12</blue>In the Lower Ninth Ward , the poorest part of the city , built in a basin and 99 percent black , bodies drifted lifelessly with the floodwater . <br><blue>13</blue>Many fled to the Superdome , the stadium where 10,000 people displaced by the hurricane had already sought refuge , but it too became cut off by the water . <br><blue>14</blue>And rescue services were overrun as the disaster that reached deep into neighboring <e3>Mississippi </e3>and <e0>Alabama </e0>unfolded , an entire region deprived of electricity , communications and drinking water . <br><blue>15</blue>Finally , the <e4>National </e4><e4>Guard </e4>was deployed , and managed to restore a semblance of order , helping coordinate airlifts and bus evacuations that scattered survivors across the country . <br></div>
