<blue>1</blue>Elaborating on the ` axis of evil ' <e0><eC>PRESIDENT </eC></e0><e0><eC>GEORGE </eC></e0><e0><eC>Bush </eC></e0><e0><eC>'s </eC></e0>National Security Adviser <e1><eC>Condoleezza </eC></e1><e1><eC>Rice </eC></e1>has recently `` defined '' the context and scope of the term `` axis of evil '' that <e0>Bush </e0>used in <e0><eC>his </eC></e0>State of the Union address a few weeks ago to describe <e3>Iraq </e3>, <e2>Iran </e2>and <e4>North </e4><e4>Korea </e4>. <br><blue>2</blue>The criteria set by <e1>Rice </e1>are the following : the three countries in question are repressive and grave human rights violators , and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction . <br><blue>3</blue>By all conservative estimates , there are scores of other countries which can easily qualify as repressive and violating human rights . <br><blue>4</blue>The rule , as far as human rights are concerned , is that every nation which does not enjoy pluralistic democracy is violating human rights and is therefore oppressive . <br><blue>5</blue>There are many countries in the world that hardly qualify as pluralistic democracies . <br><blue>6</blue>On this count , the national security adviser may have erred . <br><blue>7</blue>As for her wording regarding acquisition of weapons , what is particularly noteworthy is the use of the words `` aggressively seeking '' nuclear , biological or chemical weapons . <br><blue>8</blue>In other words , countries which are seeking or developing such arsenal at a slow pace do not seem to come within the scope of the `` axis of evil '' . <br><blue>9</blue>One can name more than a dozen countries which are contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one speed or another . <br><blue>10</blue>All other countries which are seemingly refraining from acquiring such weapons are doing so not so much to escape being branded as `` evil '' but rather because they have neither the knowledge nor the money to join the `` nuclear club '' . <br><blue>11</blue>Come to think of it , acquiring weapons of mass destruction per se may not be a correct basis for judging whether a nation is good or evil . <br><blue>12</blue>The mere development or possession of mass destruction weapons is not in itself a reason to label a state as evildoer . <br><blue>13</blue>After all , the <e5>US </e5>is the first nation to have developed nuclear weapons . <br><blue>14</blue>Moreover , the <e5>US </e5>is the first and only nation ever to deploy such weapons . <br><blue>15</blue>Perhaps the real criterion in this context is whether the nuclear country is democratic in every sense of the word . <br></div>
