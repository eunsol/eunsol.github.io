<blue>1</blue>Recent weeks have seen important developments on both sides of the <e0>Atlantic </e0>for the policy pursued in combating climate change . <br><blue>2</blue>In <e3>Europe </e3>, the council of environment ministers concluded a formal political agreement on 4 March on the decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before 1 June this year . <br><blue>3</blue>With this major decision , the <e4>European </e4><e4>Union </e4>is opening the door to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in August 2002 in <e6>Johannesburg </e6>. <br><blue>4</blue>In <e8><eC>the </eC></e8><e8><eC>United </eC></e8><e8><eC>States </eC></e8>, on 14 <e2><eC>February </eC></e2><e2><eC>President </eC></e2><e2><eC>Bush </eC></e2>presented the <e8>US </e8>national climate protection program . <br><blue>5</blue>It should be remembered that after <e2>Bush </e2>described the Kyoto Protocol as `` fundamentally flawed '' international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed . <br><blue>6</blue><e8><eC>The </eC></e8><e8><eC>United </eC></e8><e8><eC>States </eC></e8>, the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases -LRB- 25 percent of global emissions -RRB- withdrew from an international agreement that , for the first time , set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection . <br><blue>7</blue>We now know that the <e8>US </e8>withdrawal did not stop the world community from deepening this important multilateral agreement for combating climate change . <br><blue>8</blue>The <e4>European </e4><e4>Union </e4>played a dominant role in these negotiations and the community of states concluded , at the <e1>Bonn </e1>and <e7>Marrakech </e7>conferences of July and October last year , an agreement that sets out how to implement the Kyoto Protocol and provides for an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations that could possibly serve as a model for other agreements and that suggests a possible strengthening of international institutional structures in the environmental field . <br><blue>9</blue>This must now be ratified by all the parties and will shortly enter into force . <br><blue>10</blue>However , all the parties repeated with insistence that world climate protection can not be effective unless <e8><eC>the </eC></e8><e8><eC>United </eC></e8><e8><eC>States </eC></e8>takes measures that are comparable to these taken by <e3>Europe </e3>and <e5>Japan </e5>. <br><blue>11</blue>Unfortunately , the recent <e8>US </e8>climate protection program falls far short of meeting such expectations . <br><blue>12</blue>Although there is a certain satisfaction at seeing <e2><eC>President </eC></e2><e2><eC>Bush </eC></e2>recognize the need to fight climate change , that must not in any way conceal the extreme weakness of what <e2><eC>he </eC></e2>announced . <br><blue>13</blue>Under the <e8><eC>US </eC></e8>program , <e8>US </e8>emissions as a proportion of GDP must fall by 18 percent between 2002 and 2012 , or in other words energy efficiency must increase by 18 percent . <br><blue>14</blue>This can hardly be described as ambitious as a 15 percent increase in energy efficiency was in any event expected given present productivity levels . <br><blue>15</blue>In addition , if the <e8>US </e8>economy continues to grow , the increased energy efficiency will be cancelled out or more than cancelled out . <br></div>
