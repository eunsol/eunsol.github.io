<blue>1</blue>It 's not another ice age , but at least it 's cooler As countries gear up for battles over ratifying the 1997 <e6>Kyoto </e6><e6>Protocol </e6>, a recent study suggests that the world already has stepped along the path to a future cooler than it might have been . <br><blue>2</blue>Researchers at <e7><eC>NASA </eC></e7><e7><eC>'s </eC></e7><e3>Goddard </e3><e3>Institute </e3><e3>for </e3><e3>Space </e3><e3>Studies </e3>-LRB- <e2>GISS </e2>-RRB- in <e9>New </e9><e9>York </e9>report that declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere 's ability to retain heat . <br><blue>3</blue>The researchers link the slower rate to implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol , in which countries agreed to phase out production of gases that erode the <e1>Earth </e1>'s protective ozone layer . <br><blue>4</blue>Known collectively as chlorofluorocarbons , these gases also trap heat thousands of times as effectively as carbon dioxide - the main focus of <e5>Kyoto </e5>. <br><blue>5</blue>If the rate of increase in greenhouse gases had been maintained at the peak reached in 1980 , the climate by 2050 would have reached temperatures not currently anticipated until 2100 , when CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere are expected to have doubled , the researchers calculate . <br><blue>6</blue>The slowdown also `` is due in part to the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide , for reasons that are n't well understood and need more study , '' notes <e4>James </e4><e4>Hansen </e4>, <e4><eC>the </eC></e4><e4><eC>NASA </eC></e4><e4><eC>researcher </eC></e4><e4><eC>who </eC></e4><e4><eC>conducted </eC></e4><e4><eC>the </eC></e4><e4><eC>study </eC></e4><e4><eC>with </eC></e4><e4><eC>Makiko </eC></e4><e4><eC>Sato </eC></e4><e4><eC>, </eC></e4><e4><eC>also </eC></e4><e4><eC>with </eC></e4><e2><eC>the </eC></e2><e2><eC>GISS </eC></e2>. <br><blue>7</blue>The slower growth in carbon-dioxide concentrations could be due to increased <e0>CO </e0>2 uptake by land-based plants and marine organisms , <e4><eC>he </eC></e4>suggests . <br><blue>8</blue>The work grows out of a longer-term effort by the two scientists to explore paths to adjusting the globe 's thermostat other than the politically charged effort embodied in <e6><eC>the </eC></e6><e6><eC>Kyoto </eC></e6><e6><eC>Protocol </eC></e6>. <br><blue>9</blue>By focusing on carbon dioxide , the pact sets its sights on curbing the greenhouse gas held most responsible for contributing to the climate 's warming during the past century . <br><blue>10</blue>But curbs on CO 2 mean curbs on burning coal , oil , and natural gas - the fuels of booming economies . <br><blue>11</blue>Drs. <e4>Hansen </e4>and <e10>Sato </e10>argue that policymakers can make significant headway by attacking other pollutants such as black carbon soot , ozone -LRB- smog -RRB- in the lower atmosphere , and methane from landfills , mining , and oil and gas production . <br><blue>12</blue>The duo calculates that by reducing methane emissions by 30 percent , for example , the effect on climate would be comparable to the effect from cuts in CO 2 envisioned by <e6><eC>the </eC></e6><e6><eC>Kyoto </eC></e6><e6><eC>Protocol </eC></e6>during its first commitment period , which runs from 2008 to 2012 . <br><blue>13</blue>Their study appeared in the Dec. 18 , 2001 , issue of the Proceedings of the <e8>National </e8><e8>Academy </e8><e8>of </e8><e8>Science </e8>. <br><blue>14</blue>back to top Untitled Copyright @ 2002 The Christian Science Monitor . <br><blue>15</blue>All rights reserved . <br></div>
