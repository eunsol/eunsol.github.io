'' <br><blue>4</blue><e0>Arizona </e0>Governor <e4>Jan </e4><e4>Brewer </e4>Friday approved the law , which makes it a crime to stay illegally in <e6><eC>the </eC></e6><e6><eC>United </eC></e6><e6><eC>States </eC></e6>. <br><blue>5</blue>Seen as the toughest legislation in the nation , the law will require anyone whom police suspect of being in the country illegally to produce `` an alien registration document , '' such as a green card , or other proof of citizenship such as a passport or <e0>Arizona </e0>driver 's license . <br><blue>6</blue>The law has aroused controversy among many leaders and international organizations . <br><blue>7</blue>`` We join the appeal of U.S. President <e1>Barack </e1><e1>Obama </e1>to the <e6>U.S. </e6><e2>Congress </e2>to realize that it is the time to boost a migratory reform to regularize the situation of more than 11 million undocumented people living in <e6><eC>the </eC></e6><e6><eC>United </eC></e6><e6><eC>States </eC></e6>, '' the statement said . <br><blue>8</blue><e3>Honduran </e3>deputies on Tuesday also condemned the new law , considering it `` cruel '' and `` discriminatory . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Lawmakers said more than 1 million <e3>Honduran </e3>people live in <e6><eC>the </eC></e6><e6><eC>United </eC></e6><e6><eC>States </eC></e6><e6><eC>, </eC></e6><e6><eC>most </eC></e6><e6><eC>of </eC></e6><e6><eC>whom </eC></e6><e6><eC>are </eC></e6>undocumented . <br><blue>10</blue>Therefore , it was of national interest to solve the immigration issue . <br></div>
