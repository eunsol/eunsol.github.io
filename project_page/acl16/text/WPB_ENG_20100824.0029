<blue>1</blue>Woman Wall Street Hates Most Is Right for the Job . <br><blue>2</blue>Seventy-five years ago this month , a <e5>Lockheed </e5><e5>Orion </e5><e5>Explorer </e5>airplane crashed in <e7>Point </e7><e7>Barrow </e7>, <e0>Alaska </e0>. <br><blue>3</blue>The one passenger , a rugged man originally from <e6>Oklahoma </e6><e6>Indian </e6><e6>Territory </e6>, died on impact along with the pilot . <br><blue>4</blue>The dead passenger had stalked <e9>Washington </e9>insiders for decades and those who had been in his sights breathed a sigh of relief . <br><blue>5</blue>But the rest of the nation mourned <e10>Will </e10><e10>Rogers </e10>. <br><blue>6</blue>Now another plain-spoken Oklahoman , this time a 61-year-old grandmother named <e8>Elizabeth </e8><e8>Warren </e8>, is chasing some <e9>Washington </e9>special-interest folks up hill and down dale simply by standing up for consumers and politely saying out loud what ordinary <e1>Americans </e1>are thinking . <br><blue>7</blue>Before some in the financial industry and their capital cohorts continue their attacks on <e8>Warren </e8>, they would be well advised to consider some of <e10>Will </e10><e10>Rogers </e10>' sage advice that has stood the test of time : <e4>Lettin </e4>' the cat out of the bag is a whole lot easier than puttin ' it back in . <br><blue>8</blue>Earlier this month , an industry lobbyist said <e8>Warren </e8>could n't manage the <e2>Consumer </e2><e2>Financial </e2><e2>Protection </e2><e2>Bureau </e2>in a fair and balanced way because <e8><eC>she </eC></e8>wants to protect ordinary <e1>Americans </e1>from bad financial products . <br><blue>9</blue>In other words : Anyone who has been involved in consumer protection should be disqualified from heading an agency that was created to provide protection to consumers . <br><blue>10</blue>Go figure . <br><blue>11</blue>In recent years , most people appointed as federal financial-industry regulators have either been lobbyists or have come from inside the industry . <br><blue>12</blue>So it 's not surprising that many <e1>Americans </e1>are fed up and furious about the revolving door between industry and federal agencies . <br><blue>13</blue>If industry is going to fight the appointment of regulators simply because they have a background in consumer advocacy , it is high time for a full public airing of the qualifications and industry ties of appointees over the last decade and the results -- preferably through the <e3>Financial </e3><e3>Crisis </e3><e3>Inquiry </e3><e3>Commission </e3>. <br><blue>14</blue>Do industry leaders really want this cat out of the bag ? <br><blue>15</blue>There is nothing in <e8><eC>Warren </eC></e8><e8><eC>'s </eC></e8>long academic and public - service record that indicates any unwillingness to consider all sides of a question . <br></div>
