This post is about searching for a tenure-track computer science faculty position in an R1 university mainly in the United States. There are many helpful resources [[1](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/academic-job.html),[2](https://yisongyue.medium.com/checklist-of-tips-for-computer-science-faculty-applications-9fd2480649cc)] about looking for a faculty position as a PhD student or postdoc, but I could not find much resources for being on the faculty job market as a faculty. There are some unique challenges in being on the job market as a professor which this article focuses on.  


**Background**: I was in the faculty job market Fall 2019-Spring 20 and then again Fall 2023-Spring 24. The my first search landed me a tenure-track faculty position in the computer science department at UT Austin (where I worked from Fall 2020, after the gap year at Google Research NYC). I had a wonderful time at the computer science department at UT (supportive and excellent colleagues, strong students, etc) but decided to look for a new job mainly because I did not feel at home in Austin. In Fall 2024, I started my new position as a tenure-track faculty at NYU Courant Computer Science and Data Science Institute. 


Decision to apply, preparing for application
=======================================================================================

__Why are you applying?__ Largely two scenarios: (a) You are happy where you are and your research group is thriving. You might have been approached by other institutions (likely with a stronger profile than your current institution), encouraging you to apply. You might not be approached but wonder whether you can move to an institution that is preferable to you. (b) You are unhappy where you are, or you have some issues (e.g., two-body problem) that you’d like to address. In this case, examine your issues and see if they are addressable, as being on a job market/moving is a consuming process. 

__Should you contact people at other schools?__ It’s probably a good idea if you know the researchers at the institution that you are applying to. This will give you some calibration on how feasible an offer from each institution could be. I don’t think it is necessary, but it might be more natural and helpful to contact people as you know more people in the community at this career stage. If you contact them and their response is lukewarm, (I think) unfortunately the chance of getting an offer is relatively low.

__When is a good time to apply?__ Compared to progression from PhD or postdoc to a faculty position, moving as a professor is often optional and you can decide when you will be on the market. 

* You should have some signs of success as a faculty, funding, fellowships, cool papers with your students, student placement, etc. Of course this all depends on how advanced you are in your career, the longer you were a faculty, more substantial achievement would be expected.   
* It is considered *harder* to get a tenured offer as the bar for a tenured offer is substantially higher than the bar for a non-tenured offer (and you have to go through the tenure process again).  
* It is not easy to look for a new academic opportunity after one year of professorship, as you haven’t shown your aptitude as a professor. There are people who move after one year, but that’s a slightly different category: basically you are evaluated as you were the year before, but some institutions might not have had a slot to hire you that year.   
* I applied after 3.5 years as a faculty member. I’ve heard this or a year earlier (2.5 years as a faculty member) is a reasonable time frame. Right before tenure is also another time as you are preparing a tenure packet which looks similar to an application packet. 

__Which institutions to apply to?__ Your search is likely to be narrower as you already have a job! I only applied to places that I would at least consider moving in good conscience. Others might take a more Machiavellian approach and apply to places that you *know* you wouldn’t go for leverage. For me, the list of schools was a lot smaller than my first application (maybe about half of the places) and I ended up interviewing only at places that I did not interview in the first round. 

__How should you plan your academic year if you have decided to be on the job market?__ If possible, try to avoid teaching in the spring semester. This will make your life substantially less stressful. Also, not recruiting too many PhD students this cycle might be wise. I recruited one student who moved with me to the new institution. I also said no to some collaborative grant opportunities. It’s a bit more common to have interviews in the fall semester for senior hires (this is partially because senior hires take a lot longer to process) so you might have to be prepared for a job talk a bit earlier than before. 

Applications, Job talk, Interviews
===============================================================================      
Preparing for job market materials (application packet and job talk) does not differ substantially from the first round. But you are expected to have more arms-length letters — someone who is not your PhD supervisor or very close collaborators who can provide somewhat objective opinions. I ended up having 6 letters, 2 from my PhD supervisors, and the other 4 from people who I have never worked directly with. This part felt *easier* than the first time. I have more research to talk about (because I have a group of students working with me), and the same for teaching and diversity statements.

Interviewing itself, at least for me, felt OK. I felt less pressure to prove myself — I am doing the job that I am asking for already. It might be more intimidating if you were interviewing schools much better than your current institution. 

People will question your motivation to move. There are a few risk factors in the hiring committee’s perspective. (a) are you *really* interested in joining their team or want an offer that can help you improve your situation at the current institution? (b) would you be unhappy here as well and leave after a few years? You should have a good answer to both questions.

Negotiations, Decision making
=======================================================================================
Your current institution might provide you with a retention offer. When you go to talk with your current chair about it, it’d be helpful to have a clear idea of what you want in your retention offer.

Many people **do not** move after the successful second job search. If you have gotten to this point, it means that you were professionally successful *enough* at your current institution. Your retention offer can also address the sources of dissatisfaction at the current institution. 

Moving is costly and inertia is a strong force. When you come this far despite the inertia, you probably have a decent reason to move. When I talked to academics who have moved, they were mostly happy about their choice (e.g., I haven’t found one who said “I wish I stayed at the old institution.”). However, this might be true with people who stayed – people in general do not like to regret their life choices. ;) 

__Negotiation__ Many things are similar as in the first time job market. Here are some new things: 

* Startup package: You will likely get a new startup grant, partially to compensate for the grants that in your current institution that are hard to move.   
* Students: You will discuss how many of your students will transfer, and under what condition. Compare the degree requirements carefully and what requirements your students have to complete at the new institution to graduate. If some students are not moving to a program but would like to physically move to your new institution, how would the new institution support this? You should also ask about students that you have admitted this cycle if they can get admitted.   
* Tenure clock: Check how much of the time you have worked in your previous institution will count towards the tenure clock at the new institution and also for sabbatical (two clocks can be different).

The negotiation will look different depending on the nature of your move. If you are “moving up”, the new institution is less likely to fully acknowledge your (and your student’s) time at previous institutions and less willing to automatically admit your students.


Afterwards
=======================================================================================
Once you have made your decision to move, there are a few things to be adjusted: (1) your grant, facilities (compute resources, lab setup), tenure process, (2) your students and their personal life and (3) your personal life. 

* __Grants / Facilities__:   
  It would be very helpful to other PIs at the old institution who can sign paperwork for your students/take over your grants, etc. Overall, this process will vary significantly from institution to institution. You have very little leverage with your previous institution at this point, so have to rely on their kindness. Assuming you were a good colleague/employee at your current job, they will largely be supportive as long as it is not too costly to them. I’m sharing what I have learned and heard from other people.   
  * Some external grants (e.g., NSF) are relatively easy to move institutions. If you are applying for a multi-year grant during the transition (e.g., NSF CAREER) during the transition process, check with the program manager carefully to decide through which institution you should be submitting a grant proposal with.   
  * Sponsored research projects are movable but not as simple. You might find it easier to find a co-PI who can take over the grant and sponsor students you are leaving behind.   
  * Gift account: I’ve heard various scenarios, from your gift account getting frozen as soon as you receive an outside offer to the old institution allowing you to take your gift account to the new institution. I think in theory your gift account is tied to your institution.  
  * Startup account: This also depends and it is up to the discretion of your institution.   
  * Compute resources: I do not think you can easily take your compute resources to a new institution but the old institution can allow your students to access your compute resources left at the old institution.   
* __Your status__: You can also ask to be “on-leave” status for a year or two instead of resigning from your previous position right away. This will make the transition a bit smoother, as your PI status, grant, can have more time to transition. If this does not work, you will resign and likely be re-appointed as an adjunct faculty. Moving jobs is different from graduating. Previous employee does not hold the same status as the alumni and some of the privileges you had (e.g., university sponsored email account, google scholar page associated with it) can be taken away as you resign. I've been advised that resigning from a job within a year of getting a employer-sponsered greencard is not recommended.

* __Your students__:   
  * How much of your lab to move: I have seen PIs provide an option to move with you to only a subset of their students in their lab (either those early in the program, or stronger students you would like to focus on, etc). The restriction can also come from the new institution, if you have a large group. My lab wasn’t that big so I gave three options to all my PhD students: (1) transfer to a new PhD program and physically move (2) physically move without transferring their PhD program and (3) stay at an old institution and be remotely advised. I did not try to move masters or undergraduate students and said I’ll remotely advise them. 

    You might need to be careful what to offer depending on your funding situations (e.g., your money at the previous institution disappears as you leave but your students all want to stay at the previous institution). In many cases, there are ways around it, just with different layers of bureaucracy.   
  * Their degree program: It’s not obvious which fulfilled requirements (both courses and other things such as TA) will count towards those of the new institution. It’ll take some time to figure this out.    
  * When to tell them: I told my students *after* I signed the offer. I thought the news can create unnecessary stress and distraction to my students (especially if there is a chance you might stay). The students have no agency in the situation, and their life can change substantially (at least for the next few years) depending on your decision. You can take a different approach and be open about your search. There’s some advantage to this, as it can make their transition easier (e.g., their apartment lease, etc). I’ve also heard that some students try to look for other advisors after you disclose your decision to look for other jobs.   
  * How to tell them: I wrote an email, briefly explaining my decision, how it will impact them and what decisions they have to make (by what timeline). I did this to give them time to process things, but you can prefer to tell them in person (though I’ve heard some stories in-person telling didn’t go well).   
  * Moving in the spring semester can be tricker for students as they often have a year-long lease starting in the fall semester. I gave them flexibility on when they can move to the new institution.  

Stress management
===============================================================================
Here are a few things that were difficult during my second job market. I do not have solutions but it might be helpful for you to know what lies ahead. Some of these are pretty specific to my situation and you might encounter different pain points or have much smoother transitions.

* **Perspective:** You likely have been on the other side of recruiting as a faculty. I was a part of the faculty hiring committee, which helped me gain perspective. However, it also made me feel anxious. I now *know* that the process is unpredictable, and having a good track record and research potential does not guarantee a job offer. It is a complex function of what slots are available, what other candidates are on the market, what are the hiring priorities for the department, which faculty is strongly invested in the hiring process, and many other factors that are *external* to the research potential of the candidate.  
* **Time**: Unlike the first time, you are functioning as a PI — leading a research group, teaching students — so you are busier.  
* **Emotions:** If you are moving because you are unhappy, that creates fear. What if I’m going to be unhappy at the new job? I did not have this fear during the first job market. I was just very excited about my first faculty position! I wanted my first position to work out beautifully, and acknowledging that it is not working for me was emotionally difficult.   
* **Impact on the lives of others:** During the first job market, my move impacted mostly me and people who are personally connected to me. People at the “old job” (my PhD institution) all expected me to graduate and start my own journey, so it was not a surprise to anyone, and everyone was supportive. During the second job market, your move will impact more people — your research group, your collaborators, your institution. Unfortunately, for many of them, it can be an unwelcome change (despite their support of you as a friend), especially if you were a decent colleague. This should not impact your decision process, but I still found it stressful. Also, you can even be on the market at the same time with your own Ph.D students…    
* **Handling secrecy**: I mentioned in my cover letter to consider my application confidential. But there’s no guarantee they will keep it confidential. At some point during my job search, a senior faculty in my institution asked me if I am looking to leave. Looking for a new job opportunity is not wrong (but you probably will feel bad, at least I did), yet I felt it is good to be discreet. Knowing that you are looking to move might hinder collaboration/opportunities at your current institution. I did not enjoy having a secret but also did not want to discuss my job market with others. I broke the news to most of my colleagues/professional friends only after I signed the offer.   
* **Smaller support network**: During the first round of the job market, my advisors and their lab were very supportive. During the second round, my advisors were still very supportive but I felt much less comfortable asking for help. It is not easy to ask help from people at your current institution either. I reached out to my friends in other institutions who helped me with my job talk, materials, etc.

Okay, I’d like to end on a slightly positive note. Changing the environment is challenging, but I also see it as a potential path for growth. Moving expands your professional network and perspectives, and there’s excitement with it. I am happy and grateful about the connections (both personal and professional) and growth I had during my first job and am excited about the new job. Cheers! :)
