<blue>1</blue>5:14 pm Sat May 4th , 2002 -- Thirty-two non-governmental organisations -LSB- NGOs -RSB- today said they have suspended all engagements with the <e2>Malaysian </e2><e2>Human </e2><e2>Rights </e2><e2>Commission </e2>or Suhakam for 100 days since April 24 - when the latest appointments to <e2><eC>the </eC></e2><e2><eC>commission </eC></e2>took effect . <br><blue>2</blue>Speaking on behalf of the NGOs , human rights organisation , <e3>Hakam </e3>president <e10>Ramdas </e10><e10>Tikamdas </e10>said the boycott was to protest the government 's poor response to <e13>Suhakam </e13>'s numerous recommendations thus far . <br><blue>3</blue>`` The NGOs note with deep concern that the government has largely ignored Suhakam 's maiden report and its freedom of assembly report . <br><blue>4</blue>`` Whereas the Kesas report , submitted after a public inquiry , earned the disdain and wrath of the Prime Minister -LRB- <e6><eC>Dr </eC></e6><e6><eC>Mahathir </eC></e6><e6><eC>Mohamad </eC></e6>-RRB- who summarily dismissed it as a product of ` western biased ' , '' he said during a press conference at the <e12>Selangor </e12><e12>Chinese </e12><e12>Assembly </e12><e12>Hall </e12>in <e5>Kuala </e5><e5>Lumpur </e5>. <br><blue>5</blue>The Kesas report irked <e6>Mahathir </e6>after it found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering along the <e4>Kesas </e4>highway on Nov 5 , 2000 . <br><blue>6</blue>The NGOs stressed the government has also failed to respect or recognise <e13>Suhakam </e13>'s recommendations and also lamented the decline of human rights in <e7>Malaysia </e7>. <br><blue>7</blue><e10>Ramdas </e10>said the government 's failure to adhere to <e2><eC>the </eC></e2><e2><eC>commission </eC></e2><e2><eC>'s </eC></e2>recommendations creates the impression that Suhakam is nothing but `` a mere public relations tool '' . <br><blue>8</blue>`` Over the last two years , the state of human rights in <e7>Malaysia </e7>has deteriorated with increasing numbers of people detained without trial under the Internal Security Act , with blanket police ban on assemblies , with restrictions to the right of free speech and expression and with further restrictive amendments to the election laws , all of which have further denied our democratic space , '' he added . <br><blue>9</blue>The NGOs also noted that the government has yet to show its commitment and respect for universal human rights principles by ratifying the international instruments of human rights , namely the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the Covenant Against Torture . <br><blue>10</blue>Controversial appointments Meanwhile , another concern raised was <e13>Suhakam </e13>'s independence following the appointment of <e0><eC>former </eC></e0><e0><eC>attorney-general </eC></e0><e0><eC>Abu </eC></e0><e0><eC>Talib </eC></e0><e0><eC>Othman </eC></e0>as its new chairperson and the decision not to renew the appointments of three commissioners , <e1>Anuar </e1><e1>Zainal </e1><e1>Abidin </e1>, Prof <e8>Mehrun </e8><e8>Siraj </e8>and Dr <e11>Salleh </e11>Mohd Nor . <br><blue>11</blue><e10>Ramdas </e10>said it was perceived that <e1>Anuar </e1>and <e8>Mehrun </e8>, instrumental behind the scathing Kesas report , were dropped for performing their duties without fear or favour . <br><blue>12</blue>`` The fact that three commissioners have now been axed is a clear signal to other commissioners that their tenure is dependent on whether or not they have pleased the executive . <br><blue>13</blue>`` This clearly undermines the independence of <e2><eC>the </eC></e2><e2><eC>Commission </eC></e2>and will erode public 's confidence on it . '' <br><blue>14</blue>On the other hand , the NGOs said there is nothing in the public records which shows that <e0>Abu </e0><e0>Talib </e0>was committed to protecting civil liberties and advancing human rights . <br><blue>15</blue>Claiming that there was `` nothing personal '' , the NGOs said their concern was based on <e0><eC>his </eC></e0>defense of the 1987 ` <e9>Ops </e9><e9>Lalang </e9>' where more than 100 people were detained under the ISA -LSB- Internal Security Act -RSB- . <br></div>
