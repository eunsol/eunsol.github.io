<blue>1</blue>Russian ship might have missed proper linkup with space station <e1>CAPE </e1><e1>CANAVERAL </e1>-- -LRB- <e0>AP </e0>-RRB- -- A <e8>Russian </e8>supply ship docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday , but may not have latched properly into place . <br><blue>2</blue><e7>NASA </e7>officials said it was not clear whether the potential problem would delay tonight 's planned launch of space shuttle <e2>Endeavour </e2>on a station delivery mission . <br><blue>3</blue>The concern is that a loose fit might damage the orbiting complex because of the force imparted by a docking shuttle . <br><blue>4</blue>The unmanned Progress ship , carrying more than a ton of food , fuel and other supplies , was launched from <e3>Kazakstan </e3>on Monday . <br><blue>5</blue>It pulled up to the space station right on time , and the linkup initially appeared to go well . <br><blue>6</blue>But <e7>NASA </e7>later said <e8>Russian </e8>flight controllers outside <e6>Moscow </e6>did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched . <br><blue>7</blue>The space station 's steering system , turned off for the docking , remained off an extra three hours to give <e8>Russian </e8>flight controllers time to study the problem . <br><blue>8</blue>Some laboratory equipment and other items were switched off to conserve power . <br><blue>9</blue>Everything was turned back on after <e8>Russian </e8>engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough for the steering system to operate . <br><blue>10</blue><e8>Russia </e8>'s <e5>Mission </e5><e5>Control </e5>worked into the night to assess the problem . <br><blue>11</blue>Copyright 2001 <e4>Miami </e4><e4>Herald </e4><br></div>
