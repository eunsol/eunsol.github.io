<blue>1</blue>NRA Power Hangs Over Efforts to Stem Flow of Weapons to <e6><eC>Mexico </eC></e6><e6><eC>-LRB- </eC></e6><e6><eC>Washn </eC></e6><e6><eC>-RRB- </eC></e6>. <br><blue>2</blue><e9>WASHINGTON </e9>- Behind the scenes , federal agents in charge of stopping gun trafficking to <e6>Mexico </e6>have quietly advanced a plan to help stem the smuggling of high-powered AK-47s and AR-15s to the bloody drug war south of the border . <br><blue>3</blue>The controversial proposal by officials at the <e1>Bureau </e1><e1>of </e1><e1>Alcohol </e1><e1>, </e1><e1>Tobacco </e1><e1>, </e1><e1>Firearms </e1><e1>and </e1><e1>Explosives </e1>calls for a measure strongly opposed by the <e7>National </e7><e7>Rifle </e7><e7>Association </e7>: requiring gun dealers to report multiple sales of rifles and shotguns to <e0>ATF </e0>. <br><blue>4</blue>The gun issue is so incendiary and fear of the <e7>NRA </e7>so great that the <e0>ATF </e0>plan languished for months at the <e4>Justice </e4><e4>Department </e4>, according to some senior law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity but would not provide details . <br><blue>5</blue>The <e7>NRA </e7>got wind of the idea last month and warned its 4 million members in a `` grassroots alert '' that the administration might try to go around <e2>Congress </e2>to get such a plan enacted as an executive order or rule . <br><blue>6</blue>An <e0>ATF </e0>spokesman declined to comment about the matter . <br><blue>7</blue>Attorney General <e3>Eric </e3><e3>Holder </e3>declined to be interviewed . <br><blue>8</blue><e5>Matt </e5><e5>Miller </e5>, <e5><eC>a </eC></e5><e5><eC>spokesman </eC></e5><e5><eC>for </eC></e5><e5><eC>the </eC></e5><e4>Justice </e4><e4>Department </e4>, said `` the administration continues to support common-sense measures to stem gun violence . '' <br><blue>9</blue>In the past few days , the plan has quietly gained traction at <e4>Justice </e4>. <br><blue>10</blue>But sources told <e8>The </e8><e8>Washington </e8><e8>Post </e8>they fear that if the plan becomes public , the <e7>NRA </e7>will marshal its forces to kill it . <br><blue>11</blue>Such is the power of the <e7>NRA </e7>. <br><blue>12</blue>With annual revenue of about $ 250 million , the group has for four decades been the strongest force shaping the nation 's gun laws . <br><blue>13</blue>The fate of the <e6>Mexican </e6>gunrunning rule is only the most recent example of how the gun lobby has consistently outmaneuvered and hemmed in <e0>ATF </e0>, using political muscle to intimidate lawmakers and erect barriers to tougher gun laws . <br><blue>14</blue>Over nearly four decades , the <e7>NRA </e7>has wielded remarkable influence over <e2>Congress </e2>, persuading lawmakers to curb <e0>ATF </e0>'s budget and mission and to call agency officials to account at oversight hearings . <br><blue>15</blue>The source of the <e7>NRA </e7>'s power is its focus on one issue and its ability to get pro-gun candidates elected . <br></div>
