<blue>1</blue>Space station 's railcar slightly off track <e2>CAPE </e2><e2>CANAVERAL </e2>- -LRB- <e0>AP </e0>-RRB- -- Astronauts sent the international space station 's new railcar rolling slowly down a short stretch of track Monday , but it quickly hit a snag that interrupted the inaugural run of the first permanent railroad in orbit . <br><blue>2</blue><e3>NASA </e3>blamed the problem on weightlessness . <br><blue>3</blue>Engineers suspect the one-ton car floated ever so slightly off the rail , causing the magnetic sensors on the bottom of the car to lose contact with a pair of iron strips in the aluminum tracks . <br><blue>4</blue>The railcar will eventually be used during the next stages of the space station 's construction . <br><blue>5</blue>The track runs along a 44-foot girder that space shuttle Atlantis ' astronauts delivered and bolted to the orbiting outpost last week . <br><blue>6</blue>The problem cropped up after the empty flatcar moved down 17 feet of track at a snail 's pace of less than a half-inch per second . <br><blue>7</blue>Right on cue , the car stopped at a work station and was automatically latching itself down when everything came to a halt . <br><blue>8</blue>Ground controllers took over manual control and , a few hours later , were able to latch the railcar to the track . <br><blue>9</blue><e4><eC>Space </eC></e4><e4><eC>station </eC></e4><e4><eC>astronaut </eC></e4><e4><eC>Carl </eC></e4><e4><eC>Walz </eC></e4>sent another computer command from inside to get the railcar moving again . <br><blue>10</blue>The railcar smoothly rolled 26 feet to a second work station , where the same thing happened . <br><blue>11</blue>Again , ground controllers had to take over manual control to secure the car . <br><blue>12</blue>Later Monday , <e4>Walz </e4>commanded the railcar to move for the third and final time , back down the same 26 feet of track . '' <br><blue>13</blue>The train 's leaving the station , '' <e4><eC>he </eC></e4>called out . <br><blue>14</blue>It got to where it was going , but the automatic latching system shut down again and ground controllers had to step in as before . '' <br><blue>15</blue>I think what we 're finding out as we go through this is how the mobile transporter works in zero-g , '' said <e1>Ben </e1><e1>Sellari </e1>, <e1><eC>a </eC></e1><e1><eC>NASA </eC></e1><e1><eC>manager </eC></e1>. <br></div>
