<blue>1</blue><e12>US </e12>President <e0>Bush </e0>has ordered the <e11>US </e11><e11>Central </e11><e11>Intelligence </e11><e11>Agency </e11>-LRB- <e1>CIA </e1>-RRB- to assassinate <e12>America </e12>'s opponents wherever in the world they may be ! <br><blue>2</blue>This directive is issued at a time when the <e12>American </e12>government is claiming to lead the fight against terrorism throughout the world . <br><blue>3</blue>When the Imam -LRB- may God be satisfied with him -RRB- issued the fatwa against <e9>Salman </e9><e9>Rushdie </e9>for insulting the Prophet -LRB- peace be upon him -RRB- and the holy <e6>Koran </e6>, the countries that are so-called supporters of human rights protested against the fatwa . <br><blue>4</blue>They said it was an act of terrorism that was against international law and said it crushed human rights principles ! <br><blue>5</blue>In a coordinated move the <e2>European </e2>countries all recalled their ambassadors from <e10>Tehran </e10>in order to put the <e5>Islamic </e5><e5>Republic </e5><e5>of </e5><e5>Iran </e5>under pressure . <br><blue>6</blue>By clarifying the Imam 's edict the <e5>Islamic </e5><e5>Republic </e5><e5>of </e5><e5>Iran </e5>made the people of the world understand that insulting the <e8>Prophet </e8>was in fact violating the rights of millions of people throughout the world . <br><blue>7</blue>This was not simply a directive from God that was confirmed by all the clerics throughout the <e4>Islamic </e4>world . <br><blue>8</blue>Now <e12><eC>the </eC></e12><e12><eC>United </eC></e12><e12><eC>States </eC></e12>has issued an assassination order against millions of human beings without having any proof , reason or documentation . <br><blue>9</blue>The only reason for this would be opposition to <e12><eC>the </eC></e12><e12><eC>United </eC></e12><e12><eC>States </eC></e12>. <br><blue>10</blue>It would therefore be appropriate for all <e4>Islamic </e4>countries to withdraw their ambassadors from <e12><eC>the </eC></e12><e12><eC>United </eC></e12><e12><eC>States </eC></e12>. <br><blue>11</blue>If the <e2>European </e2>countries were honest in the withdrawal of their ambassadors from Iran , blaming <e5>Iran </e5>for violating human rights , then they should recall their ambassadors from <e12><eC>the </eC></e12><e12><eC>United </eC></e12><e12><eC>States </eC></e12>. <br><blue>12</blue>After all the <e12>United </e12><e12>States </e12>is not violating the rights of one human being , but many many human beings . <br><blue>13</blue>It seems that following the blow that the <e12>Americans </e12>received on September 11 in <e7>New </e7><e7>York </e7>and <e13>Washington </e13>, <e12><eC>the </eC></e12><e12><eC>United </eC></e12><e12><eC>States </eC></e12>is determined to take justice to pre-historic times . <br><blue>14</blue>It is obvious no country will put up with this cruelty . <br><blue>15</blue>No one will allow this human achievement , which is the discovery of <e3>God-given </e3>human rights , which is achieved after thousands of years of research , to be wasted away . <br></div>
