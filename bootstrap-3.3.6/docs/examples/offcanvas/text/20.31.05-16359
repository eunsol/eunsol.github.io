<blue>1</blue><e18>US </e18>Secretary of <e15>State </e15><e13>Colin </e13><e13>Powell </e13>, described as one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush 's administration , is trying to `` patch up '' President <e2>Bush </e2>'s statements , especially his latest one in which he made reckless threats at the `` axis of evil , '' namely <e8>Iran </e8>, <e9>Iraq </e9>and <e12>North </e12><e12>Korea </e12>. <br><blue>2</blue>A day after President <e2>Bush </e2>'s threat to crush these countries and use all means to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction , <e13><eC>Secretary </eC></e13><e13><eC>Powell </eC></e13>said before the <e14>Senate </e14><e14>Foreign </e14><e14>Relations </e14><e14>Committee </e14>that `` characterizing these counties as the axis of evil does not mean that his government intends to invade them . '' <br><blue>3</blue>He added : `` We are prepared to initiate a dialogue , and we want to work with our friends and allies in the world on ways of dealing with such regimes . '' <br><blue>4</blue>These are fine words , but they do not reflect the reality , because the hard-line wing in the <e18>US </e18>administration comprising Vice President <e5>Dick </e5><e5>Cheney </e5>, Secretary of <e4>Defense </e4><e6>Donald </e6><e6>Rumsfeld </e6>, and National Security Adviser <e3>Condoleezza </e3><e3>Rice </e3>have the final say in running affairs at the <e20>White </e20><e20>House </e20>, and have direct influence on President <e2>Bush </e2>. <br><blue>5</blue>Oddly enough , speculations swirled in <e19>Washington </e19>that <e13>Powell </e13>listened to President <e2>Bush </e2>'s speech and <e13><eC>his </eC></e13>threats to `` the axis of evil '' like any other <e18>US </e18>citizen . <br><blue>6</blue><e13><eC>He </eC></e13>had not read the speech before President <e2>Bush </e2>delivered it , as he was supposed to do by virtue of his post . <br><blue>7</blue>The fact that <e13><eC>he </eC></e13>subsequently denied these speculations does not mean they are baseless . <br><blue>8</blue>At any rate , <e13><eC>Secretary </eC></e13><e13><eC>Powell </eC></e13><e13><eC>'s </eC></e13>remark about the <e18>US </e18>administration 's readiness to enter dialogue with these `` evil '' states and with <e19><eC>Washington </eC></e19><e19><eC>'s </eC></e19>friends on ways of dealing with them involves some contradictions . <br><blue>9</blue>For <e13><eC>he </eC></e13>affirmed in the first speech that there would be no dialogue with <e9>Iraq </e9>until after it has accepted the return of the <e17>UN </e17>arms inspectors . <br><blue>10</blue>The current <e18>US </e18>administration will consult with no one , not even its closest allies , whether in <e7>Europe </e7>or its followers in the <e16>Third </e16><e16>World </e16>, particularly in the <e0>Arab </e0>world . <br><blue>11</blue>The <e18>US </e18>administration has already decided to `` punish '' any country it believes poses a danger to <e15><eC>the </eC></e15><e15><eC>Hebrew </eC></e15><e15><eC>State </eC></e15>. <br><blue>12</blue>It lumped <e12>North </e12><e12>Korea </e12>with <e8>Iran </e8>and <e9>Iraq </e9>as part of the `` axis of evil '' only to mislead <e0>Arabs </e0>and <e11>Muslims </e11>and to create the impression that <e10>Islam </e10>is not alone targeted . <br><blue>13</blue>The <e18>United </e18><e18>States </e18>is these days ruled by an alliance between two main lobbies , the arms lobby and the <e21>Zionist </e21>lobby , which sees <e16><eC>the </eC></e16><e16><eC>world </eC></e16>through the eyes of <e1>Ari'el </e1><e1>Sharon </e1>and <e1><eC>his </eC></e1>extremist government . <br><blue>14</blue>We therefore have to expect the worst in the near future . <br><blue>15</blue>President <e2>Bush </e2>is facing a recession and an economic crisis . <br></div>
