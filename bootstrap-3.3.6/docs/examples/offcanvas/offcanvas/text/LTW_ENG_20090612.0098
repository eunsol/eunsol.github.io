<blue>1</blue><e2><eC>Deeply </eC></e2><e2><eC>Polarized </eC></e2><e2><eC>Iran </eC></e2>Heads to the Polls . <br><blue>2</blue>A long column of provincial , working-class <e2>Iranians </e2>, clad in black and walking on flip-flops , streamed into a highway underpass , heading for a reelection rally for <e0><eC>President </eC></e0><e0><eC>Mahmoud </eC></e0><e0><eC>Ahmadinejad </eC></e0>. <br><blue>3</blue>Standing on a high ledge safely out of the way , a group of cosmopolitan youths looked down at the crowd of mostly out-of-towners . <br><blue>4</blue>`` Go back to the zoo ! '' <br><blue>5</blue>shouted a teenager with gelled-up hair and a green T-shirt , a sign of support for <e0><eC>Ahmadinejad </eC></e0><e0><eC>'s </eC></e0>main challenger , <e4>Mir </e4><e4>Hossein </e4><e4>Mousavi </e4>. <br><blue>6</blue>`` Sissies ! '' <br><blue>7</blue>the marchers yelled back . <br><blue>8</blue>As <e2>Iranians </e2>go to the polls Friday to choose a president , the country is more deeply polarized than at any time since the <e3>Islamic </e3>revolution that overthrew the shah 30 years ago . <br><blue>9</blue>After a bitter campaign that included personal attacks on some of <e2><eC>Iran </eC></e2><e2><eC>'s </eC></e2>leading families , both sides are preparing to contest the results , and many <e2>Iranians </e2>wonder whether the social and economic rifts exposed by the election will deepen . <br><blue>10</blue>`` Some people think that only they are <e2>Iran </e2>, '' said <e5>Saeed </e5><e5>Majidi </e5>, who had driven for hours on <e5><eC>his </eC></e5>125cc motorcycle to hear <e0>Ahmadinejad </e0>speak at <e6>Tehran </e6>'s <e1>Grand </e1><e1>Mosque </e1>. <br><blue>11</blue>`` But those with jobs and money only represent 30 percent of the population . '' <br><blue>12</blue>`` We are <e2>Iran </e2>, '' <e5>Majidi </e5>concluded , pointing at the crowd pouring into the tunnel , a sea of women with sunburned faces and bearded men with black horn-rimmed glasses . <br><blue>13</blue>`` Other presidents never cared for us . <br><blue>14</blue><e0>Ahmadinejad </e0>does . '' <br><blue>15</blue>Though <e0><eC>he </eC></e0>holds many of the levers of power , <e0>Ahmadinejad </e0>is proud of <e0><eC>his </eC></e0>status as an outsider . <br></div>
