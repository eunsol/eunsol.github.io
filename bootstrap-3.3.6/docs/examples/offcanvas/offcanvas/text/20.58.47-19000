<blue>1</blue>Mr <e3>Jaume </e3><e3>Matas </e3>, Minister for Environment , <e6>Spanish </e6>Presidency of the <e2>EU </e2>Mrs <e4>Margot </e4><e4>Wallstrom </e4>, Commissioner for Environment , European Commission It is clear that the proposals for <e7>US </e7>action on climate change are domestic . <br><blue>2</blue>But <e2><eC>the </eC></e2><e2><eC>EU </eC></e2>is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce <e7>US </e7>emissions . <br><blue>3</blue>The `` intensity target '' proposed allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change . <br><blue>4</blue>On the contrary , the Kyoto Protocol requires most industrialised countries to achieve absolute emission reductions , while they still foresee to have growing economies . <br><blue>5</blue>The Climate Change Convention of 1992 , to which <e7><eC>the </eC></e7><e7><eC>US </eC></e7>is a <e5>Party </e5>, requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels . <br><blue>6</blue>Achieving this would only be a first step towards stabilising global greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous climate change . <br><blue>7</blue>This is the ultimate objective of the <e1>Convention </e1>to which <e7><eC>the </eC></e7><e7><eC>US </eC></e7>has subscribed . <br><blue>8</blue>However , the new plan does not lead to such a stabilisation , but instead will lead to the increase of absolute emission levels . <br><blue>9</blue>Over the past years , greenhouse gas emissions intensity in relation to GDP has been falling in <e7><eC>the </eC></e7><e7><eC>US </eC></e7>. <br><blue>10</blue>The <e0>Bush </e0>plan is based on a prolongation of this trend thereby in effect foreseeing little more than continuation on a `` business-as-usual '' path . <br><blue>11</blue>Current emission projections for <e7><eC>the </eC></e7><e7><eC>US </eC></e7>indicate an increase of 39 % above 1990 levels in 2012 . <br><blue>12</blue>While the intensity improvements may reduce this to around 33 % , this is still a very substantial increase in absolute emissions . <br><blue>13</blue><e2><eC>The </eC></e2><e2><eC>EU </eC></e2>is concerned about the purely voluntary nature of the actions proposed . <br><blue>14</blue>Furthermore , a review of the effectiveness of the measures will not take place before 2012 . <br><blue>15</blue>It is striking that the approach which is considered beneficial for other air pollutants , namely to implement cap-and-trade programmes , is not extended to CO2 emissions from the power sector . <br></div>
