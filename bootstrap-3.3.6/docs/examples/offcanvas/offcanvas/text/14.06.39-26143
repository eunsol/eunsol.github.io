<blue>1</blue>WHAT THEY SAID : No tears for <e11>Tobin </e11>, but some for <e14>al-Qaeda </e14>Author : <e4>Jane </e4><e4>Taber </e4><e8><eC>Taber </eC></e8><e8><eC>OTTAWA </eC></e8>- The plight of prisoners and politicians has been weighing heavily on the minds of editorial writers and pundits in and around the nation 's capital . <br><blue>2</blue>It 's been a week now since <e5>Jean </e5><e5>Chretien </e5>'s Cabinet shuffle and the dramatic departure of <e11>Brian </e11><e11>Tobin </e11>-- seven days during which the print pundits have had time to ponder his actions . <br><blue>3</blue>And what they have said about him has not been pretty . <br><blue>4</blue>Still , before discussing the antics of <e11><eC>Mr. </eC></e11><e11><eC>Tobin </eC></e11>and the elevation of <e8><eC>Ottawa </eC></e8><e8><eC>'s </eC></e8><e6>John </e6><e6>Manley </e6>to the status of golden boy , there is the controversial , and more pressing , matter of the plight of the <e14>al-Qaeda </e14>fighters imprisoned at a <e12>U.S. </e12>military base in <e1>Cuba </e1>. <br><blue>5</blue>`` Even thugs deserve humane treatment , '' reads the headline of the <e8>Ottawa </e8>Citizen editorial . <br><blue>6</blue>`` Conditions for detainees in <e3>Guantanamo </e3><e3>Bay </e3>are harsh : wire-mesh cells 2.4 by 1.8 metres , a sleeping mat and blanket , a bucket for a toilet , '' writes the <e12>Citizen </e12>. <br><blue>7</blue>`` But that does n't necessarily make them inhumane . <br><blue>8</blue>On the other hand , <e12>U.S. </e12>assurances that it 's treating the prisoners humanely do n't mean that 's so . '' <br><blue>9</blue>The <e12>Citizen </e12>argues that <e0>Canada </e0>should `` insist '' the <e12>United </e12><e12>States </e12>`` allow a ` competent tribunal ' to decide the legal status of the detainees , as required by the Geneva Convention . <br><blue>10</blue>... <e0><eC>That </eC></e0>might make <e0><eC>it </eC></e0>more difficult to find <e7>Osama </e7><e7>bin </e7><e7>Laden </e7>and <e7><eC>his </eC></e7>remaining thugs . <br><blue>11</blue>But laws keep us from behaving like them . '' <br><blue>12</blue>The <e9>Sudbury </e9><e9>Star </e9>agrees : `` This conflict must now move to its next stage . <br><blue>13</blue>A tribunal , formed by the <e13>United </e13><e13>Nations </e13>, must address the issue of these captured fighters and determine how they will be dealt with . '' <br><blue>14</blue>Editorial writers at The <e2>Daily </e2><e2>Press </e2>in <e10>Timmins </e10>disagree . <br><blue>15</blue>In an editorial appearing this week , the newspaper is unequivocal in its <e12>U.S. </e12>support . <br></div>
