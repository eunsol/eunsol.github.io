<blue>1</blue>CORRECTED : <e0>Australian </e0>deputy PM at boiling point over <e6>Ramsay </e6>rant . <br><blue>2</blue>Celebrity <e6><eC>chef </eC></e6><e6><eC>Gordon </eC></e6><e6><eC>Ramsay </eC></e6>was told <e6><eC>he </eC></e6>should stick to cooking by <e0>Australia </e0>'s deputy prime minister Tuesday over a rant in which <e6><eC>he </eC></e6>suggested a female TV presenter was a lesbian . <br><blue>3</blue>The <e1>British </e1>cook attacked <e5>Nine </e5><e5>Network </e5>'s `` A Current Affair '' presenter <e2>Tracy </e2><e2>Grimshaw </e2>at a <e4>Melbourne </e4>cooking expo on Saturday , the day after she interviewed him . <br><blue>4</blue>In front of thousands of onlookers , <e6>Ramsay </e6>suggested <e2>Grimshaw </e2>was a lesbian and needed `` to see <e7>Simon </e7><e7>Cowell </e7>'s botox doctor . '' <br><blue>5</blue><e6><eC>He </eC></e6>also showed a picture of a woman apparently naked on all fours with the face of a pig and said `` that 's <e2>Tracy </e2><e2>Grimshaw </e2>. '' <br><blue>6</blue><e6><eC>His </eC></e6>publicist has since said the comments were a joke and not intended to cause offence . <br><blue>7</blue>But <e3><eC>Deputy </eC></e3><e3><eC>Prime </eC></e3><e3><eC>Minister </eC></e3><e3><eC>Julia </eC></e3><e3><eC>Gillard </eC></e3>was unimpressed , saying <e6>Ramsay </e6>had displayed bad manners and poor taste . <br><blue>8</blue>`` <e3><eC>I </eC></e3>understand from the publicity that <e6>Gordon </e6><e6>Ramsay </e6>is <e6><eC>a </eC></e6>good <e6><eC>chef </eC></e6>, '' <e3>Gillard </e3>said . <br><blue>9</blue>`` <e3><eC>I </eC></e3>think perhaps what <e6><eC>he </eC></e6>should do is confine <e6><eC>himself </eC></e6>to the kitchen and make nice things for people to eat rather than make public comments about others . '' <br><blue>10</blue><e2>Grimshaw </e2>also hit back at the `` Hell 's Kitchen '' supremo , labelling <e2><eC>him </eC></e2>an `` arrogant narcissist '' on <e3><eC>her </eC></e3>current affairs show on Monday night . <br><blue>11</blue><e3><eC>She </eC></e3>said there was nothing funny about <e6><eC>Ramsay </eC></e6><e6><eC>'s </eC></e6>insults , which had upset <e3><eC>her </eC></e3>friends and family , including <e3><eC>her </eC></e3>mother . <br><blue>12</blue>`` Truly , <e3><eC>I </eC></e3>wonder how many people would laugh if they were effectively described as an old , ugly pig , '' <e3><eC>she </eC></e3>said , adding that <e3><eC>she </eC></e3>had agreed not to probe <e6>Ramsay </e6>over an extra-marital affair when <e6><eC>he </eC></e6>appeared on the show . <br><blue>13</blue><e2>Grimshaw </e2>said <e3><eC>she </eC></e3>initially considered not responding to <e6><eC>Ramsay </eC></e6><e6><eC>'s </eC></e6>comments but decided <e3><eC>she </eC></e3>had to stand up for <e3><eC>herself </eC></e3>. <br><blue>14</blue>`` We all know that bullies thrive when no one takes them on and <e3><eC>I </eC></e3>'m not going to sit meekly and let some arrogant narcissist bully <e3><eC>me </eC></e3>, '' <e3><eC>she </eC></e3>said . <br><blue>15</blue>`` Obviously <e6>Gordon </e6>thinks that any woman who does n't find <e6><eC>him </eC></e6>attractive must be gay , '' <e3><eC>she </eC></e3>added . <br></div>
