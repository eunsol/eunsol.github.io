<blue>1</blue><e4><eC>Mexico </eC></e4><e4><eC>'s </eC></e4>War on Civil Rights . <br><blue>2</blue>When <e5><eC>President </eC></e5><e5><eC>Barack </eC></e5><e5><eC>Obama </eC></e5>goes to <e2>Guadalajara </e2>, <e4>Mexico </e4>, this weekend for the North American Leaders Summit , <e5><eC>he </eC></e5>will surely praise <e0><eC>Mexican </eC></e0><e0><eC>President </eC></e0><e0><eC>Felipe </eC></e0><e0><eC>Calderon </eC></e0><e0><eC>for </eC></e0><e0><eC>the </eC></e0>courage <e0><eC>he </eC></e0><e0><eC>has </eC></e0><e0><eC>displayed </eC></e0><e0><eC>fighting </eC></e0><e0><eC>the </eC></e0>war <e0><eC>on </eC></e0><e0><eC>drugs </eC></e0>. <br><blue>3</blue>The applause is well deserved . <br><blue>4</blue><e0>Calderon </e0>has turned the crackdown on drug traffickers into the centerpiece of <e0><eC>his </eC></e0>administration and has pursued organized crime with undeniable zeal . <br><blue>5</blue>But before <e5>Obama </e5>becomes too effusive and pats <e0>Calderon </e0>on the back for a job well done , it 's important that the <e7>U.S. </e7>president remember the cost and the consequences of his counterpart 's crusade . <br><blue>6</blue>In <e4>Mexico </e4>today , human rights violations committed by the military and the police in this effort are on the rise , yet punishment for the perpetrators remains elusive . <br><blue>7</blue>So although <e5>Obama </e5>should recognize <e0><eC>Calderon </eC></e0><e0><eC>'s </eC></e0>efforts , <e5><eC>he </eC></e5>should also insist that drug lawlessness can not be combated by breaking the law and that the army must be subjected to the kind of scrutiny it has shunned so far . <br><blue>8</blue>Today , more than 45,000 soldiers police the roads of <e4><eC>Mexico </eC></e4><e4><eC>'s </eC></e4>main cities and drug-producing areas as part of a strategy designed to confront drug traffickers and contain the violence they wreak . <br><blue>9</blue>Many ring leaders have been captured , many drug shipments have been confiscated and many smugglers have been imprisoned . <br><blue>10</blue>But violence remains unabated , and the unintended consequences of <e0><eC>Calderon </eC></e0><e0><eC>'s </eC></e0>efforts have become distressingly clear : The number of cases of human rights violations brought before the <e4>Mexican </e4><e4>Human </e4><e4>Rights </e4><e4>Commission </e4>has risen by 600 percent over the last two years . <br><blue>11</blue>The war on drugs is turning into a war on the civilian population that ca n't simply be dismissed as collateral damage . <br><blue>12</blue><e4><eC>Mexico </eC></e4><e4><eC>'s </eC></e4>military is capturing `` capos , '' but it 's also raping , extracting confessions through torture and detaining people arbitrarily . <br><blue>13</blue>Crime is begetting more crime . <br><blue>14</blue>In light of this , <e7>U.S. </e7>Sen. <e6>Patrick </e6><e6>Leahy </e6>, <e1>D-Vt. </e1>, was right this week to call `` premature '' the <e8>U.S. </e8><e8>State </e8><e8>Department </e8>'s draft report claiming that <e4>Mexico </e4>has fulfilled <e4><eC>its </eC></e4>human rights obligations under the so-called <e3>Merida </e3><e3>Initiative </e3>. <br><blue>15</blue><e6><eC>He </eC></e6>is right to remind officials on both sides of the border that in return for <e3>Merida </e3>'s $ 1.4 billion in counter-narcotics aid from the <e7>United </e7><e7>States </e7>, the <e0>Calderon </e0>government made promises it has not kept . <br></div>
