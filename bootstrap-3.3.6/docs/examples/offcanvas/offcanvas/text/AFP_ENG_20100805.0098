<blue>1</blue>Appeal lodged after <e1>California </e1>gay marriage ban overturned . <br><blue>2</blue>Opponents of same-sex marriage formally challenged on Thursday a decision to overturn <e1><eC>California </eC></e1><e1><eC>'s </eC></e1>ban on gay weddings , launching an appeals process expected to end up before <e2><eC>the </eC></e2><e2><eC>US </eC></e2><e2><eC>Supreme </eC></e2><e2><eC>Court </eC></e2>. <br><blue>3</blue><e7>US </e7><e9><eC>District </eC></e9><e9><eC>Court </eC></e9><e9><eC>Judge </eC></e9><e9><eC>Vaughn </eC></e9><e9><eC>Walker </eC></e9>ruled Wednesday in favor of activists who argued that a state referendum which barred gays and lesbians from tying the knot was discriminatory and therefore violated the US Constitution . <br><blue>4</blue>The referendum , known as Proposition 8 , was passed by a 52 percent majority in November 2008 , only six months after <e2>California </e2><e2>'s </e2><e2>Supreme </e2><e2>Court </e2>overturned a previous ban on same-sex weddings , sending gays and lesbians flocking to marry . <br><blue>5</blue>Socially conservative opponents of same-sex weddings reacted furiously to the decision , accusing <e9>Walker </e9>-- who is gay -- of allowing <e9><eC>his </eC></e9>sexual orientation to influence <e9><eC>his </eC></e9>ruling . <br><blue>6</blue><e5><eC>Randy </eC></e5><e5><eC>Thomasson </eC></e5><e5><eC>of </eC></e5><e5><eC>the </eC></e5><e3>Campaign </e3><e3>for </e3><e3>Children </e3><e3>and </e3><e3>Families </e3><e5><eC>-LRB- </eC></e5><e5><eC>SaveCalifornia.com </eC></e5><e5><eC>-RRB- </eC></e5>described the decision as a `` terrible blow '' to voter rights . <br><blue>7</blue>`` <e9><eC>Judge </eC></e9><e9><eC>Walker </eC></e9>has ignored the written words of the Constitution , which <e9><eC>he </eC></e9>swore to support and defend and be impartially faithful to , and has instead imposed <e9><eC>his </eC></e9>own homosexual agenda upon the voters , the parents and the children of <e1>California </e1>, '' <e5>Thomasson </e5>said . <br><blue>8</blue><e6><eC>The </eC></e6><e6><eC>president </eC></e6><e6><eC>of </eC></e6><e6><eC>the </eC></e6><e0>American </e0><e0>Family </e0><e0>Association </e0>, <e6>Tim </e6><e6>Wildmon </e6>, meanwhile accused <e9><eC>Walker </eC></e9><e9><eC>of </eC></e9><e9><eC>a </eC></e9><e9><eC>`` </eC></e9>tyrannical <e9><eC>, </eC></e9>abusive <e9><eC>and </eC></e9>utterly unconstitutional <e9><eC>display </eC></e9>of judicial arrogance . '' <br><blue>9</blue>Legal experts believe the case is almost certain to end up before the <e8>US </e8><e8>Supreme </e8><e8>Court </e8>in around two years time , once appeals hearings in lower courts have run their course . <br><blue>10</blue>In <e6><eC>his </eC></e6>opinion released on Wednesday , <e9>Walker </e9>ruled that Proposition 8 failed to `` advance any rational basis '' to deny gay men and lesbians marriage licenses . <br><blue>11</blue>`` Indeed the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the <e1>California </e1>constitution the notion that opposite sex couples are superior to same sex couples , '' <e9>Walker </e9>wrote . <br><blue>12</blue>`` Because <e1><eC>California </eC></e1>has no interest in discriminating against gay men and lesbians and because Proposition 8 prevents <e1>California </e1>from fulfilling its constitutional obligations to provide marriages on an equal basis , the court concludes that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional . '' <br><blue>13</blue><e9>Walker </e9>later issued a ruling granting a temporary stay of <e9><eC>his </eC></e9>order until Friday , allowing opponents of same-sex marriage time to file their appeals , a move that appeared to prevent an immediate resumption of weddings between gays and lesbians in the most populous <e7>US </e7>state . <br><blue>14</blue><e9>Walker </e9>is expected to decide whether same-sex weddings can resume in <e1>California </e1>by Friday . <br><blue>15</blue>A crowd of several hundred people celebrated <e9><eC>Walker </eC></e9><e9><eC>'s </eC></e9>decision in <e4>Los </e4><e4>Angeles </e4>' gay enclave of <e10>West </e10><e10>Hollywood </e10>late Wednesday . <br></div>
