<blue>1</blue>Why <e3><eC>Kyoto </eC></e3>is <e3><eC>a </eC></e3><e3><eC>rip-off </eC></e3>According to a study released last week by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters , implementation of the 1997 <e3>Kyoto </e3>global warming treaty would cost our economy 450,000 jobs and as much as $ 40-billion . <br><blue>2</blue>But <e2>Jean </e2><e2>Chretien </e2>is not worried . <br><blue>3</blue>`` I do n't accept these figures , '' the Prime Minister said . <br><blue>4</blue>`` There is nothing to be gained by frightening people when all the facts are not known . '' <br><blue>5</blue>But the $ 40-billion figure , far from being conceived to `` frighten '' <e0>Canadians </e0>, is plucked straight from government documents . <br><blue>6</blue>According to a report released in 2000 by the <e4>National </e4><e4>Air </e4><e4>Issues </e4><e4>Co-ordinating </e4><e4>Committee </e4><e4>on </e4><e4>Climate </e4><e4>Change </e4>, a group staffed by officials from the federal , provincial and territorial governments , hitting <e0><eC>Canada </eC></e0><e0><eC>'s </eC></e0><e3>Kyoto </e3>target may mean `` the loss of roughly one year 's growth , or , viewed in absolute terms , in 2010 , the loss in annual economic output of approximately $ 40-billion -LRB- or $ 1,100 per capita -RRB- . '' <br><blue>7</blue>This is not a price worth paying . <br><blue>8</blue>Governments are expected to protect the national economy , and they should deviate from that mission only when crucial national interests are at stake -LRB- fighting terrorism , for example -RRB- . <br><blue>9</blue>Yet rising temperatures pose little threat to <e0>Canada </e0>. <br><blue>10</blue>In <e0><eC>its </eC></e0>authoritative Feb. , 2001 , report on the projected impacts of global warming , the <e1>Intergovernmental </e1><e1>Panel </e1><e1>on </e1><e1>Climate </e1><e1>Change </e1>identified several threats to <e0>Canadian </e0>ecosystems , but concluded that our farmers would generally benefit from warmer temperatures . <br><blue>11</blue>-LRB- Non-farming <e0>Canadians </e0>, most of whom spend at least part of the winter months scraping ice off their cars , chopping firewood and shovelling their walks , will profit as well . -RRB- <br><blue>12</blue>As for the globally felt benefits that would follow from <e0><eC>Canada </eC></e0><e0><eC>'s </eC></e0>implementation of the <e3>Kyoto </e3>protocol , they are slight . <br><blue>13</blue>By 2010 , our $ 40-billion sacrifice would yield an expected reduction in annual carbon and carbon-equivalent emissions of about 46-million tonnes -- just 1/200th of the world 's total projected greenhouse gas output . <br><blue>14</blue>Even if <e0>Canada </e0>managed to convince the <e6>United </e6><e6>States </e6>and every other <e3>Kyoto </e3>signatory to ratify the protocol , world carbon dioxide emissions would still soar . <br><blue>15</blue>According to the <e5>U.S. </e5><e5>Energy </e5><e5>Information </e5><e5>Administration </e5>, world energy consumption will increase by about 60 % between now and 2020 , with most of the upsurge expected to come from developing nations , which are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol . <br></div>
